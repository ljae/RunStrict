## 1. Project Overview

### Concept

A location-based running game that gamifies territory control through hexagonal maps.

- **Season**: Fixed **280 days** (Gestation period metaphor).
- **Reset**: On D-Day (D-0), all territories and scores are deleted (The Void). Only personal history remains.

### Core Philosophy

| Surface Layer | Hidden Layer |
|---------------|--------------|
| Red vs Blue competition | Connection through rivalry |
| Territory capture | Mutual respect growth |
| Weekly battles | Long-term relationships |
| "Win at all costs" | "We ran together" |

### Key Differentiators

- **Natural unity discovery** through competition phases
- **Purple Crew**: Mid-season chaos mechanic — larger crew capacity for higher multiplier potential
- **Yesterday's Check-in Multiplier**: Crew benefit = yesterday's active members count (no real-time tracking)
- **The Final Sync**: No real-time hex updates — batch upload at run completion (cost optimized)
- **Server-verified points**: Points calculated by client, validated by server (≤ hex_count × multiplier)
- **Privacy-first hex system**: Minimal timestamps for fairness (last_flipped_at), no runner IDs stored

---

## 2. Rule Definitions

### 2.1 Season & Time System

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Season Duration | 280 days (D-280 → D-0) |
| Server Timezone | GMT+2 (Israel Standard Time) |
| Season Start | Immediately after previous season ends |
| Purple Unlock Day | D-140 (midpoint) |

**Rules:**
- The server operates on an absolute countdown. All users share the same timeline.
- Remaining days vary by entry point (e.g., joining at D-260 vs D-5).
- On D-0, all Flip Points, Crew data, and Rankings are wiped.
- Personal running history (Calendar/DailyStats) persists across seasons.
- No daily settlement cycle — points are calculated in real-time.

### 2.2 Teams & Factions

| Team | Code | Display Name | Emoji | Color | Base Multiplier |
|------|------|-------------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Red | `red` | FLAME | 🔥 | `#FF003C` | 1x |
| Blue | `blue` | WAVE | 🌊 | `#008DFF` | 1x |
| Purple | `purple` | CHAOS | 💜 | `#8B5CF6` | 1x |

**Rules:**
- On first entry, user MUST choose Red or Blue.
- Team choice is locked for the entire season.
- **Exception**: User can defect to Purple after D-140 (see §2.7).
- Purple is NOT available at season start.
- All teams have the same base multiplier (1x). Advantage comes from crew size (see §2.5).

### 2.3 Crew System

#### 2.3.1 Red/Blue Crews

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Max Members | 12 |
| Formation Rule | Same-color members only |
| Membership | One person, one crew |
| Entry Security | Optional 4-digit PIN (stored plaintext for MVP) |
| Max Simultaneous Multiplier | 12x |

**Rules:**
- Any Red/Blue user can create a crew.
- `memberIds[0]` is the crew leader (creator).
- Users can voluntarily withdraw at any time. No cooldown.
- If the leader leaves, leadership auto-transfers to the next oldest member (`memberIds[1]`).
- If a crew reaches 0 members, it is automatically deleted.
- Crew representative image is auto-generated by the app on creation.
- When a user joins a crew, their avatar is forcibly changed to the crew's representative image.
  - **Avatar preservation**: The user's original personal avatar is saved to `original_avatar` column.
  - When the user leaves the crew, their avatar is automatically restored from `original_avatar`.

#### 2.3.2 Purple Crews

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Max Members | 24 |
| Formation Rule | Any user who has defected to Purple |
| Unlock Condition | Season reaches D-140 |
| Entry Cost | All existing Flip Points reset to 0 |
| Max Simultaneous Multiplier | 24x |

**Rules:**
- Only users who defect from Red/Blue can join Purple.
- Defection permanently changes team for the remainder of the season.
- User MUST leave their current crew before defecting to Purple.
- Any Purple user can create a new Purple crew.
- Purple's advantage is crew capacity (24 members = up to 24x multiplier vs Red/Blue's 12x max).

### 2.4 Hex Capture Mechanics

#### 2.4.1 Hex Grid Configuration

**Base Gameplay Resolution:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| H3 Resolution | **9** (Base) |
| Avg Hex Edge Length | ~174m |
| Avg Hex Area | ~0.10 km² |
| Target Coverage | Block level (~170m radius) |

> All flip points are calculated at Resolution 9. This ensures equal point value for every hex regardless of geographic location.

**Geographic Scope Resolutions (for MapScreen & Leaderboard):**

| Scope | H3 Resolution | Avg Edge | Avg Area | Purpose |
|-------|---------------|----------|----------|---------|
| ZONE | 8 (Parent of 9) | ~461m | ~0.73 km² | Neighborhood leaderboard |
| CITY | 6 (Parent of 9) | ~3.2km | ~36 km² | District leaderboard |
| ALL | 4 (Parent of 9) | ~22.6km | ~1,770 km² | Metro/Regional leaderboard |

> H3 uses Aperture 7: each parent hex contains ~7 children. Scope filtering uses `cellToParent()` to group users by their parent hex at the scope resolution.

#### 2.4.2 Capture Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Pace Threshold | < 8:00 min/km **moving average (last 20 sec)** |
| Speed Cap | < 25 km/h (anti-spoofing) |
| GPS Accuracy | Must be ≤ 50m to be valid |
| GPS Polling | Fixed 0.5 Hz (every 2 seconds) |
| Trigger | GPS coordinate enters hex boundary (immediate) |
| Color Logic | Hex displays color of LAST runner only |
| Stored Data | `lastRunnerTeam` + `last_flipped_at` (no runner ID) |

**Rules:**
- A hex changes color when a valid runner's GPS enters the hex boundary.
- "Valid runner" = **moving average pace (last 20 sec)** < 8:00 min/km AND speed < 25 km/h AND GPS accuracy ≤ 50m.
- **Moving Average Pace (20 sec)** = average pace over the last 20 seconds of movement.
  - At 0.5Hz GPS polling, provides ~10 samples for stable pace calculation.
  - Smooths out GPS noise and momentary speed fluctuations.
  - Prevents false captures from GPS jumps.
  - This means a runner can walk for 10 minutes, then jog for 20+ seconds to capture hexes.
- Purple runners paint hexes purple (regardless of original team before defection).
- No ownership mechanic — only "who ran here last".
- Accelerometer validation is required even in MVP (anti-spoofing).

#### 2.4.3 Flip Definition

A **Flip** occurs when a hex changes color (any color change counts).

| Transition | Is Flip? | Points? |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Neutral → Red | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Neutral → Blue | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Red → Blue | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Blue → Red | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Red → Purple | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Blue → Purple | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Red → Red (same team) | ❌ No | 0 |

**No streak bonus.** No flip caps of any kind (unlimited flips per day, same hex can be flipped multiple times).

### 2.5 Economy & Points

#### 2.5.1 Flip Points

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Earning Method | Flipping a hex (any color change) |
| Base Points Per Flip | 1 |
| Multiplier | Yesterday's crew check-in count (see §2.5.2) |
| Scope | Individual (not shared with crew) |
| Reset | Wiped on D-0 (season end) |

**Rules:**
- All Flip Points belong to the individual, not the crew.
- Points are calculated at run completion ("The Final Sync").
- Multiplier is determined by yesterday's crew activity (not real-time).
- No streak bonuses. No daily total cap. **No daily hex limit** (same hex can be flipped multiple times per day).

#### 2.5.2 Yesterday's Check-in Multiplier (Crew Benefit)

> **Design Goal**: Eliminate real-time simultaneous runner tracking to reduce server load and operational costs.

The core crew benefit: **multiplier = number of crew members who completed at least one run YESTERDAY.**

| Yesterday's Check-ins | Today's Multiplier | Example (1 flip) |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 1x | 1 point |
| 3 | 3x | 3 points |
| 5 | 5x | 5 points |
| 12 (Red/Blue max) | 12x | 12 points |
| 24 (Purple max) | 24x | 24 points |

**Rules:**
- "Check-in" = completing at least 1 run (any distance) on the previous day.
- Multiplier is calculated once daily at midnight (GMT+2) and fixed for the entire day.
- All crew members running today use the **same** multiplier (yesterday's count).
- No real-time tracking of concurrent runners required.
- Example: If 5 crew members ran yesterday, everyone in the crew earns 5 points per flip today.
- **Mid-day crew change**: If a user changes crew during the day, they keep their **previous crew's multiplier** until tomorrow. New crew's multiplier applies starting the next day.
- **New users/crews**: If no "yesterday" data exists (new user or new crew), default multiplier is **1x**.
- **Solo runners (no crew)**: Multiplier UI is **hidden**. Points are calculated at 1x but not displayed.

**Advantages:**
- **Server efficiency**: Multiplier calculated once per day via Edge Function, not per-second.
- **Predictability**: Users know their multiplier at the start of each day.
- **Strategy**: Crews can plan around yesterday's activity without coordination pressure.

**Purple Advantage:**
- Purple has NO base multiplier bonus.
- Purple's advantage is purely crew capacity: max 24 members = potential 24x vs Red/Blue's max 12x.
- This means Purple crews benefit more from consistent daily participation.

#### 2.5.3 Points Calculation Flow ("The Final Sync")

> **Design Goal**: Eliminate real-time hex synchronization. All data is uploaded at run completion.

```
[During Run - Local Only]
  Runner GPS → Client validates locally
  Hex flip detected → Client records to local hex_path list
  Points calculated locally using yesterday's multiplier (cached)
  NO server communication during run

[Run Completion - Batch Sync]
  RunSession.endTime = now()
  Client uploads:
    → run_summary: { endTime, distanceKm, hex_path[], yesterdayCrewCount }
  
  Server processes (RPC: finalize_run):
    → Count flips in hex_path (color changes from current hex state)
    → Award points: total_flips × multiplier
    → Conflict Resolution: Later endTime wins hex color
    → UPDATE hexes SET last_runner_team = team WHERE endTime > existing
    → UPDATE users SET season_points += total_points_earned
    → INSERT INTO run_history (lightweight stats, preserved across seasons)
```

**Conflict Resolution Rule ("Later Run Wins"):**
- `hexes` table stores `last_flipped_at` timestamp (run's endTime when hex was flipped).
- When multiple runners pass through the same hex, **the runner whose run ended later wins** the hex color.
- This prevents offline abusing: a runner cannot submit an old run to overwrite recent activity.
- Server compares `run_endTime` with existing `last_flipped_at`:
  - If `run_endTime > last_flipped_at` → Update hex color and timestamp
  - If `run_endTime ≤ last_flipped_at` → Skip update (hex already claimed by later run)
- Example: User A (run ends 10:00) passes Hex #123. User B (run ends 09:30) syncs later.
  - **User A wins** because their run ended later, regardless of sync order.
- **Flip points**: Calculated by client, **validated by server** (points ≤ hex_count × multiplier).

### 2.6 Ranking & Leaderboard

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Type | Season cumulative only (no daily/weekly) |
| Ranking Metric | Individual accumulated Flip Points |
| Crew Affiliation Impact | None (purely individual) |
| Display | Top rankings per geographic scope based on user's "home hex" |

#### 2.6.1 Home Hex System (Asymmetric Definition)

> **Design Goal**: Determine user's ranking scope based on their most recent running location, with privacy-preserving asymmetry.

**Home Hex Definition (Asymmetric):**

| User Type | Home Hex Definition | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Current User (self)** | **FIRST hexagon** of most recent run (start point) | Privacy: Don't reveal where you ended |
| **Other Users** | **LAST hexagon** of most recent run (end point) | Standard: Most recent location |

- The Home Hex is updated at run completion (part of "The Final Sync").
- Home Hex determines which ZONE/CITY/ALL scope the user belongs to for leaderboard filtering.
- **Privacy Rationale**: By using the START hex for yourself, your actual ending location (potentially your home) is not revealed to others viewing your ranking scope.
- **Zero-hex run**: If `hex_path` is empty (GPS failed, indoor run, etc.), **home hex is NOT updated**. Previous home hex values are preserved.

**Geographic Scope Filters (based on Home Hex):**

| Scope | H3 Resolution | Definition | Display |
|-------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **ZONE** | 8 (Parent of 9) | Users whose Home Hex shares the same Resolution 8 parent | Neighborhood rankings (~461m radius) |
| **CITY** | 6 (Parent of 9) | Users whose Home Hex shares the same Resolution 6 parent | District rankings (~3.2km radius) |
| **ALL** | — | All users server-wide | Global rankings |

**Implementation:**
```dart
// Get user's home hex (asymmetric based on viewer)
String getHomeHex(RunSummary run, {required bool isSelf}) {
  final hexPath = run.hexPath;
  if (hexPath.isEmpty) return '';
  
  // Self sees START hex, others see END hex
  return isSelf ? hexPath.first : hexPath.last;
}

// Get user's scope hex from their home hex
String getHomeHexAtScope(String homeHex, LeaderboardScope scope) {
  return switch (scope) {
    LeaderboardScope.zone => h3.cellToParent(homeHex, 8),
    LeaderboardScope.city => h3.cellToParent(homeHex, 6),
    LeaderboardScope.all => null, // No filtering
  };
}
```

**Rules:**
- Leaderboard shows top users per selected scope based on shared parent hex.
- **Current user's scope** is determined by their own FIRST hex (start point).
- **Other users' scope** is determined by their LAST hex (end point).
- Users outside top ranks see their own rank in a sticky footer.
- Purple users have a distinct glowing border in the [ALL] view.
- Team filter tabs: [ALL] / [RED] / [BLUE] / [PURPLE].
- **Ranking snapshot**: Downloaded once on app launch, NOT polled in real-time.

### 2.7 Purple Crew: Protocol of Chaos

#### 2.7.1 Unlock & Entry

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Unlock Day | D-140 (season midpoint) |
| Entry Name | "Traitor's Gate" |
| Entry Cost | All existing Flip Points reset to **0** |
| Eligibility | Any Red/Blue user (anytime after D-140) |
| Pre-condition | Must leave current crew first |

**Rules:**
- Purple is designed as a "comeback mechanic" for underperforming players.
- Larger crew capacity (24 vs 12) compensates for the late start and point reset.
- Once defected, cannot return to Red/Blue for the remainder of the season.
- No minimum Flip Point threshold to defect (anyone can defect).
- Defection is available at any time after D-140 until season end.

#### 2.7.2 Purple Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Base Multiplier | 1x (same as Red/Blue) |
| Max Crew Size | 24 members |
| Max Simultaneous Multiplier | 24x |
| Hex Color | Purple (distinct from Red/Blue) |
| Role | "Virus/Joker" — disrupts Red/Blue territory with larger coordinated crews |

### 2.8 D-Day Reset Protocol (The Void)

| Step | Action | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Season countdown reaches D-0 | Scheduled Edge Function |
| 2 | All hex colors reset to neutral | `TRUNCATE TABLE hexes` (instant) |
| 3 | All Crew data deleted | `TRUNCATE TABLE crews CASCADE` (instant) |
| 4 | All Flip Points & team wiped | `UPDATE users SET season_points=0, crew_id=NULL, team=NULL` |
| 5 | Drop season's `runs` partitions (heavy data) | `DROP TABLE runs_p20XX_XX` (instant disk reclaim) |
| 6 | `run_history` preserved | Personal run stats untouched |
| 7 | `daily_stats` preserved | Aggregated daily stats untouched |
| 8 | Next season begins immediately (D-280) | New season record created |
| 9 | All users must re-select Red or Blue | `team = NULL` forces re-selection |

**Data Preservation:**
- ✅ Kept: `run_history` (per-run stats), `daily_stats` (aggregated daily)
- ❌ Wiped: `runs` (heavy hex_path data), Flip Points, Crew, Rankings, Hex colors, Team
- ⚡ Deletion Method: `TRUNCATE`/`DROP PARTITION` = **$0 cost, < 1 second**, no performance impact

- `currentSeasonDistance` → calculated from `dailyStats/` within season dates

#### HexModel

```dart
class HexModel {
  final String id;             // H3 hex index (resolution 9)
  final LatLng center;         // Geographic center
  Team? lastRunnerTeam;        // null = neutral, else team color
  DateTime? lastFlippedAt;     // Run's endTime when hex was flipped (for conflict resolution)

  // NO runner IDs (privacy)

  /// Returns true if color actually changed (= a flip occurred)
  bool setRunnerColor(Team runnerTeam, DateTime runEndTime) {
    if (lastRunnerTeam == runnerTeam) return false;
    // Only update if this run ended later (conflict resolution)
    if (lastFlippedAt != null && runEndTime.isBefore(lastFlippedAt!)) return false;
    lastRunnerTeam = runnerTeam;
    lastFlippedAt = runEndTime;
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### CrewModel

```dart
class CrewModel {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final Team team;              // Red, Blue, or Purple
  final List<String> memberIds; // memberIds[0] = leader
  final String? pin;            // Optional 4-digit PIN (plaintext for MVP)
  final String? representativeImage; // Auto-generated on creation

  // Derived getters
  bool get isPurple => team == Team.purple;
  int get maxMembers => isPurple ? 24 : 12;
  String get leaderId => memberIds.isNotEmpty ? memberIds[0] : '';
}
```

#### RunSession (Active Run — Hot Data)

```dart
class RunSession {
  final String id;
  final DateTime startTime;
  DateTime? endTime;
  double distanceMeters;
  List<LocationPoint> route;    // Full GPS path (active tracking)
  int hexesColored;             // Flip count during this run
  Team teamAtRun;               // Team at time of run
  List<String> hexesPassed;     // H3 hex IDs passed through

  double get distanceKm => distanceMeters / 1000;
  Duration get duration => (endTime ?? DateTime.now()).difference(startTime);
  double get paceMinPerKm => /* calculation */;
  bool get canCaptureHex => paceMinPerKm < 8.0;
}
```

#### RunSummary (Completed Run — Warm Data, Storage-Minimized)

```dart
class RunSummary {
  final String id;
  final DateTime endTime;           // Conflict resolution: later endTime wins hex
  final double distanceKm;
  final int durationSeconds;
  final double avgPaceMinPerKm;     // min/km (e.g., 6.0 = 6:00 min/km)
  final int hexesColored;           // Flip count
  final Team teamAtRun;
  final List<String> hexPath;       // H3 hex IDs passed (deduplicated, no timestamps)
  final int yesterdayCrewCount;     // Applied multiplier (yesterday's check-in count)
}
```

> **Storage Optimization**:
> - `hexPath` stores deduplicated H3 hex IDs only (no individual timestamps).
> - Raw GPS trace is NOT stored (90%+ storage savings).
> - Route shape can be reconstructed by connecting hex centers.
> - `endTime` is the sole timestamp used for conflict resolution.

#### RunHistoryModel (Per-Run Stats — Preserved Across Seasons)

```dart
/// Lightweight run history preserved across season resets.
/// Contains stats only, no heavy hex_path data.
class RunHistoryModel {
  final String id;
  final String userId;
  final DateTime runDate;           // Date of the run
  final DateTime startTime;
  final DateTime endTime;
  final double distanceKm;
  final int durationSeconds;
  final double avgPaceMinPerKm;     // min/km (e.g., 6.0 = 6:00 min/km)
  final int flipCount;              // Flips earned this run
  final int pointsEarned;           // Points with multiplier
  final Team teamAtRun;

  Duration get duration => Duration(seconds: durationSeconds);
}
```

> **Design Note**: `run_history` is separate from `runs` table.
> - `runs`: Heavy data with `hex_path` → **DELETED on season reset**
> - `run_history`: Lightweight stats → **PRESERVED across seasons** (5-year retention)

**Model Usage Clarification:**

| Model | Purpose | Contains hex_path | Used For |
|-------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| `RunSummary` | Server upload payload | ✅ Yes | `finalize_run()` RPC call |
| `RunHistoryModel` | UI display model | ❌ No | Run History Screen, Calendar |

- `RunSummary` is used ONLY for uploading to server at run completion.
- `RunHistoryModel` is used for all UI display (history list, calendar, stats).
- `runs` table (DB) stores `hex_path` for season data; `run_history` table (DB) stores stats only.
- Both tables are **independent** with no foreign key relationship.

#### DailyRunningStat (Aggregated — Preserved Across Seasons)

```dart
class DailyRunningStat {
  final String userId;
  final String dateKey;             // "2026-01-24" format
  final double totalDistanceKm;
  final int totalDurationSeconds;
  final double avgPaceMinPerKm;     // min/km (e.g., 6.0 = 6:00)
  final int flipCount;              // Total flips that day
}
```

#### LocationPoint (Active GPS — Ephemeral)

```dart
class LocationPoint {
  final double latitude;
  final double longitude;
  final double altitude;
  final double speed;               // m/s
  final double accuracy;            // meters (must be ≤ 50m)
  final DateTime timestamp;
}
```

#### RoutePoint (Cold Storage — Compact)

```dart
class RoutePoint {
  final double lat;
  final double lng;
  // Minimal data for route replay (Douglas-Peucker compressed)
}
```

### 4.2 Database Schema (PostgreSQL via Supabase)

#### Core Tables

```sql
-- Users table (permanent, survives season reset)

    END
  )
);

-- Hex map (deleted on season reset)
CREATE TABLE hexes (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,                       -- H3 index string (resolution 9)
  last_runner_team TEXT CHECK (last_runner_team IN ('red', 'blue', 'purple')),
  last_flipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ               -- Run's endTime when hex was flipped (for conflict resolution)
  -- NO runner IDs (privacy)
);

-- Active runs (DEPRECATED - kept for potential future use)
-- NOTE: NOT used for multiplier calculation (see "Yesterday's Check-in" system)
-- NOTE: Crew run-start notifications have been REMOVED to reduce complexity
-- This table may be dropped in future versions if no use case emerges
CREATE TABLE active_runs (

  crew_id UUID REFERENCES crews(id),
  start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  team TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (team IN ('red', 'blue', 'purple'))
);
```

#### Season-Partitioned Tables (pg_partman)

```sql
-- Runs table: partitioned by season (280-day periods)
CREATE TABLE runs (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  team_at_run TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (team_at_run IN ('red', 'blue', 'purple')),
  start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  end_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  distance_meters DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  avg_pace_min_per_km DOUBLE PRECISION,      -- min/km (e.g., 6.0)
  hexes_colored INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  hex_path TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',      -- H3 hex IDs passed
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Daily stats: partitioned by month
CREATE TABLE daily_stats (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  date_key DATE NOT NULL,
  total_distance_km DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  total_duration_seconds INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,

  flip_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at),
  UNIQUE (user_id, date_key, created_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Run history: lightweight stats preserved across seasons
-- Separate from runs table which contains heavy hex_path data
CREATE TABLE run_history (
  id UUID NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  run_date DATE NOT NULL,                       -- Date of the run
  start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  end_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  distance_km DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  duration_seconds INTEGER NOT NULL,
  avg_pace_min_per_km DOUBLE PRECISION,
  flip_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,        -- Flips earned this run
  points_earned INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,     -- Points with multiplier
  team_at_run TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (team_at_run IN ('red', 'blue', 'purple')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (id, created_at)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- NOTE: run_history is PRESERVED across season resets (personal history)
-- NOTE: daily_flips table REMOVED — no daily flip limit
```

#### Partition Management (pg_partman)

```sql
-- Auto-create partitions for runs (monthly)
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  p_parent_table := 'public.runs',
  p_control := 'created_at',
  p_type := 'native',
  p_interval := '1 month',
  p_premake := 3
);

-- Auto-create partitions for daily_stats (monthly)
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  p_parent_table := 'public.daily_stats',
  p_control := 'created_at',
  p_type := 'native',
  p_interval := '1 month',
  p_premake := 3
);

-- Auto-create partitions for run_history (monthly, PERMANENT - never deleted)
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  p_parent_table := 'public.run_history',
  p_control := 'created_at',
  p_type := 'native',
  p_interval := '1 month',
  p_premake := 3
  -- NO p_retention: run_history is preserved across seasons
);
```

#### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Users can only read/update their own profile
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY users_self ON users
  USING (auth_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (auth_id = auth.uid());

-- Hexes are readable by all, writable by authenticated runners
ALTER TABLE hexes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY hexes_read ON hexes FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY hexes_write ON hexes FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Active runs: DEPRECATED - RLS policies removed
-- Table kept for potential future use but no RLS policies defined
-- ALTER TABLE active_runs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  -- Disabled
```

#### Key Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_team ON users(team);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_season_points ON users(season_points DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_crew_id ON users(crew_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_active_runs_crew_id ON active_runs(crew_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_daily_stats_user_date ON daily_stats(user_id, date_key);
CREATE INDEX idx_hexes_team ON hexes(last_runner_team);
```

**Design Principles:**
- `hexes`: Only stores `last_runner_team`. No timestamps or runner IDs → privacy + cost.
- `users`: Distance stats calculated via `run_history` aggregation on-demand.
- `runs`: Heavy data with `hex_path` (H3 IDs) → **DELETED on season reset**.
- `run_history`: Lightweight stats (distance, time, flips) → **PRESERVED across seasons**.
- `crews`: `max_members` enforced via CHECK constraint. Leader = `member_ids[0]`.
- `active_runs`: DEPRECATED — kept for potential future use. Crew run-start notifications removed.
- **No daily flip limit**: Same hex can be flipped multiple times per day.
- **Multiplier**: Calculated daily via `calculate_yesterday_checkins()` Edge Function at midnight GMT+2.
- **Sync**: No real-time — all hex data uploaded via `finalize_run()` at run completion.
- All security handled via RLS — **no separate backend API server needed**.

### 4.3 Data Lifecycle & Partitioning Strategy

#### Why Partitioning Matters

The 280-day season cycle means massive data accumulates and must be efficiently deleted. Traditional row-by-row DELETE is expensive and causes:
- Index fragmentation
- VACUUM overhead
- Performance degradation during reset

**Solution**: PostgreSQL table partitioning via `pg_partman`.

#### Partition Strategy by Table

| Table | Partition Interval | Retention | D-Day Reset Method |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `runs` | Monthly | Season data only | `DROP PARTITION` (instant) |
| `run_history` | Monthly | **5 years** (then auto-deleted) | Never deleted on D-Day |
| `daily_stats` | Monthly | **5 years** (then auto-deleted) | Never deleted on D-Day |
| `hexes` | Not partitioned | Season only | `TRUNCATE TABLE` (instant) |
| `crews` | Not partitioned | Season only | `TRUNCATE TABLE` (instant) |
| `active_runs` | Not partitioned | Ephemeral | `TRUNCATE TABLE` (instant) |

**Data Retention Policy:**
- `run_history` and `daily_stats` are retained for **5 years** from creation date.
- pg_partman `p_retention` is set to `'5 years'` for these tables.
- Data older than 5 years is automatically dropped during partition maintenance.
- Account deletion triggers immediate deletion of all user data (GDPR compliance).

#### D-Day Reset Execution (The Void)

```sql
-- Season reset: executes in < 1 second regardless of data volume
BEGIN;
  -- 1. Instant wipes (TRUNCATE = instant, no row-by-row cost)
  TRUNCATE TABLE hexes;
  TRUNCATE TABLE crews CASCADE;
  TRUNCATE TABLE active_runs;
  
  -- 2. Reset user season data (UPDATE, not DELETE)
  UPDATE users SET
    season_points = 0,
    crew_id = NULL,
    team = NULL;  -- Forces re-selection
  
  -- 3. Drop season's runs partitions (heavy data, instant disk reclaim)
  -- pg_partman handles this via retention policy, or manual:
  -- DROP TABLE runs_p2026_01, runs_p2026_02, ... ;
  
  -- 4. PRESERVED tables (personal history across seasons):
  --    - run_history (per-run lightweight stats)
  --    - daily_stats (aggregated daily stats)
COMMIT;
```

**Key Advantage over Firebase/Firestore:**
- Firebase charges per-document for deletion (100万 docs = 100万 write ops = ~$0.18+)
- Supabase/PostgreSQL: `TRUNCATE`/`DROP PARTITION` = **$0, instant, no performance impact**

#### Data Flow Summary

```
[During Run - Local Only]
  Runner GPS → Client Kalman filter → Local hex_path list
  Hex flip detected → Local calculation using cached yesterday's multiplier
  NO server communication (battery + cost optimization)
  NO daily flip limit (same hex can be flipped multiple times)

[Run Completion - "The Final Sync"]
  Client uploads: { startTime, endTime, distanceKm, hex_path[], yesterdayCrewCount }
  Server RPC: finalize_run() →
    → Count flips (color changes from current hex state)
    → Conflict resolution: later endTime wins hex color
    → UPDATE hexes, users
    → INSERT INTO run_history (lightweight stats, preserved)
  
[Daily Maintenance - Edge Function (midnight GMT+2)]
  calculate_yesterday_checkins() →
    → Count crew members with ≥1 run yesterday
    → Cache multiplier for today

[D-Day - Reset Path]
  TRUNCATE hexes, crews (instant)
  UPDATE users (reset points/team)
  DROP runs partitions (heavy data, instant disk reclaim)
  run_history PRESERVED (per-run stats)
  daily_stats PRESERVED (aggregated stats)
```

### 4.4 Hot vs Cold Data Strategy

| Tier | Data | Storage | Retention | Reset Behavior |
|------|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Hot** | Hex map, Active runs | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Current season | TRUNCATE (instant) |
| **Seasonal** | `runs` (heavy with hex_path) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Current season | DROP PARTITION (instant) |
| **Permanent** | `run_history` (lightweight stats) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | **Forever** | Never deleted |
| **Permanent** | `daily_stats` (aggregated daily) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | **Forever** | Never deleted |
| **Cold** | ~~Raw GPS paths~~ **NOT STORED** | — | — | 90%+ storage savings |

> **Key Design**: Separate `runs` (heavy, deleted) from `run_history` (light, preserved).
> Raw GPS coordinates are NOT stored. Only `hex_path` (H3 IDs) is in `runs`.

**Batch Points Calculation Flow ("The Final Sync"):**

```
[Run Completion - Client uploads run_summary]
  Server RPC: finalize_run(run_summary_jsonb)
    → For each hex_id in hex_path:
      → Check current hex color
      → If color differs from runner's team → count as flip
    → Conflict Resolution:
      → UPDATE hexes SET last_runner_team = team
        WHERE endTime > existing (later run wins)
    → Calculate points: total_flips × yesterdayCrewCount
    → UPDATE users SET season_points += points
    → INSERT INTO run_history (lightweight stats, preserved)
```

> **Note**: No daily flip limit. Same hex can be flipped multiple times per day.

**Supabase Realtime Integration (Minimal Scope):**
- **NO real-time features currently required** — all data synced on app launch and run completion
- `hexes` and `users.season_points` → NO real-time broadcast (poll on app foreground)
- Crew run-start notifications → **REMOVED** (no longer needed)
- **Cost Optimization**: Eliminated ALL WebSocket usage for maximum cost savings
- Future consideration: May add real-time for crew chat if feature is added later

### 4.5 Local Storage (SQLite)

| Table | Purpose | Sync Strategy |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `runs` | Offline run data (active session) | Upload to Supabase on connectivity |
| `routes` | GPS points during active run | Compress → Supabase Storage on completion |
| `run_history` | Local cache of run history | Pull from Supabase |
| `daily_stats` | Local cache of daily stats | Pull from Supabase |
| `hex_cache` | Nearby hex data for offline | Cache visible + surrounding hexes |

---

## 5. Tech Stack & Architecture

### 5.1 Backend Platform Decision

#### Why Supabase over Firebase

| Criterion | Firebase (Firestore) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Winner |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Data Model** | NoSQL (Document) | Relational (SQL) | Supabase — crew/user/season relationships require JOINs |
| **Query Complexity** | Limited (no JOINs, no aggregation) | Full SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, SUM, Window functions) | Supabase — leaderboard & multiplier calculations |
| **Cost Model** | Per-read/write operation | Instance-based (flat rate) | Supabase — no per-operation billing explosion at scale |
| **Mass Deletion (D-Day)** | Per-document write cost ($0.18/1M deletes) | TRUNCATE/DROP = $0, instant | Supabase — critical for 280-day reset |
| **Real-time** | Firestore listeners | Supabase Realtime (WebSocket) | Tie |
| **Security** | Firebase Rules (custom DSL) | Row Level Security (SQL policies) | Supabase — standard SQL, no custom language |
| **Backend API** | Requires Cloud Functions for complex logic | RLS + Edge Functions (optional) | Supabase — no separate API server needed |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Google-proprietary | Open-source (PostgreSQL) | Supabase — can self-host if needed |
| **Scaling** | Auto-scales (but cost scales too) | Predictable instance pricing | Supabase — budget-friendly at scale |

**Decision**: **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** as primary backend.

**Key Serverless Properties:**
- No backend API server to maintain
- RLS handles all authorization at DB level
- Edge Functions only for scheduled tasks (D-Day reset, partition management, daily multiplier calculation)
- **NO Realtime/WebSocket** — all data synced via REST on app launch and run completion
- Supabase Storage for cold GPS data (replaces AWS S3)

## 8. Appendix

### A. User Identity Rules

| State | Avatar Display | Leaderboard Name |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Solo (no crew) | Personal avatar | User name |
| In Crew | Crew representative image (forced) | User name |
| Left Crew | Reverts to personal avatar | User name |
| Defected to Purple | Personal avatar (until joining Purple crew) | User name |

### B. Yesterday's Check-in Multiplier Examples

| Scenario | Yesterday's Check-ins | Today's Multiplier | Flip Points per Flip |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Solo runner (no crew) | — | 1x | 1 |
| Red crew, 3 ran yesterday | 3 | 3x | 3 |
| Blue crew, 12 ran yesterday | 12 | 12x | 12 |
| Purple crew, 20 ran yesterday | 20 | 20x | 20 |
| Purple crew, 24 ran yesterday (max) | 24 | 24x | 24 |
| Red crew, 0 ran yesterday | 0 | 1x (minimum) | 1 |

**Key Differences from Real-time System:**
- Multiplier is fixed at midnight (GMT+2), not calculated per-second.
- All crew members use the SAME multiplier throughout the day.
- No need to coordinate running times — yesterday's activity determines today's multiplier.
- Server calculates once per day via Edge Function, not on every flip.

### C. Leaderboard Geographic Scope

Geographic scope filtering uses H3's hierarchical parent cell system. Users are grouped by their parent hex ID at the scope's resolution level.

**Implementation (lib/config/h3_config.dart):**

| Scope | H3 Resolution | Map Zoom | Filter Logic |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **ZONE** | 8 | 15.0 | `cellToParent(userHex, 8)` — Neighborhood (~461m) |
| **CITY** | 6 | 12.0 | `cellToParent(userHex, 6)` — District (~3.2km) |
| **ALL** | 4 | 10.0 | No filter — server-wide ranking |

**Client Flow:**
1. Get user's current base hex (Resolution 9)
2. Convert to scope resolution via `getScopeHexId(baseHex, scope)`
3. Query Supabase RPC with scope hex ID to filter rankings

**Approximate Coverage:**
- ZONE (Res 8): ~7 base hexes, neighborhood-level competition
- CITY (Res 6): ~343 base hexes, district-level competition
- ALL (Res 4): ~16,807 base hexes, metro-wide competition

### D. Slogans

**Korean:**
- "같은 땀, 다른 색" (Same sweat, different colors)
- "우리는 반대로 달려 만났다" (We ran apart, met together)
- "배신은 새로운 시작이다" (Betrayal is a new beginning)

**English:**
- "Run Apart, Meet Together"
- "Same Path, Different Colors"
- "Embrace the Chaos"

### E. Changelog

## 9. Performance & Optimization Configuration

> **Configuration Checklist**: Select options below to optimize battery, accuracy, cost, and user experience.

### 9.1 Background Location Tracking Strategy

#### 9.1.1 Android Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Foreground Service Type** | ☑ `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_LOCATION` (Required) | ✅ |
| **Wakelock Strategy** | ☐ Partial Wakelock (CPU active during run) | |
| | ☑ No Wakelock (battery priority, may miss points) | ✅ |
| **Location Provider** | ☑ Fused Location Provider Client (FLPC) | ✅ |
| | ☐ Raw GPS only (higher accuracy, higher battery) | |
| **FLPC Priority** | ☐ `PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY` (GPS always on) | |
| | ☑ `PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY` (battery saving) | ✅ |

#### 9.1.2 iOS Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Background Mode** | ☑ `UIBackgroundModes: location` (Required) | ✅ |
| **Pause Updates Automatically** | ☑ `pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically = false` — Required | ✅ |
| | ☐ `true` (iOS may stop tracking when stationary — NOT recommended) | |
| **Activity Type** | ☑ `CLActivityType.fitness` | ✅ |
| | ☐ `CLActivityType.other` | |
| **Desired Accuracy** | ☐ `kCLLocationAccuracyBest` | |
| | ☐ `kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters` | |
| | ☑ `kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters` (battery saving, matches 50m rule) | ✅ |
| **Distance Filter** | ☑ 5 meters (battery optimization) | ✅ |

### 9.2 GPS Polling & Battery Optimization

> **Strategy**: Battery efficiency is prioritized over data precision. Fixed 0.5Hz polling with 20-second moving average window compensates for lower sample rates.

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Polling Strategy** | ☐ Adaptive Polling (variable rate based on speed) | |
| | ☑ Fixed 0.5 Hz (every 2 seconds) — battery saving, consistent behavior | ✅ |
| **Moving Average Window** | ☐ 10 seconds (~5 samples at 0.5Hz — unstable) | |
| | ☑ 20 seconds (~10 samples at 0.5Hz — stable) | ✅ |
| **Min Time Between Points** | ☐ 100ms (allows up to 10Hz) | |
| | ☑ 1500ms (allows 0.5Hz with margin) | ✅ |
| **Distance Filter (iOS)** | ☑ 5 meters — Required for battery optimization | ✅ |
| | ☐ 10 meters | |
| | ☐ `kCLDistanceFilterNone` (all updates — high battery) | |
| **Batch Buffer Size** | ☐ 10 points (write every ~20 seconds at 0.5Hz) | |
| | ☑ 20 points (write every ~40 seconds at 0.5Hz) — fewer I/O ops | ✅ |
| | ☐ 1 point (immediate write — high I/O) | |

### 9.3 Signal Processing & Noise Reduction

> **Strategy**: Use Kalman Filter to smooth hardware noise. NO Map Matching API (cost + trail accuracy).

#### 9.3.1 Kalman Filter Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Kalman Filter** | ☑ Enabled | ✅ |
| | ☐ Disabled (raw GPS only) | |
| **State Variables** | ☑ 2D (lat/lng + velocity) | ✅ |
| | ☐ 3D (lat/lng/altitude + velocity) | |
| **Dynamic Noise Covariance** | ☑ Use GPS `accuracy` field dynamically | ✅ |
| | ☐ Fixed noise covariance | |
| **Outlier Rejection Speed** | ☐ 44 m/s (≈100 mph, Usain Bolt = 12.4 m/s) | |
| | ☑ 25 m/s (≈56 mph, matches speed cap rule) | ✅ |
| | ☐ 15 m/s (≈34 mph, very strict) | |

#### 9.3.2 Map Matching Strategy

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Real-time Display** | ☑ Smoothed Raw Trace (Kalman filtered) | ✅ |
| | ☐ Mapbox Map Matching API (snaps to roads) | |
| **Post-run Display** | ☑ Same as real-time | ✅ |
| | ☐ Mapbox Map Matching API (prettier for sharing) | |
| **Map Matching API Usage** | ☑ Never (cost optimization) | ✅ |
| | ☐ Optional for post-run sharing only | |
| | ☐ Always (higher cost, road-snapped routes) | |

> **Note**: Running apps should NOT use Map Matching by default. Runners often use parks, trails, and tracks that aren't on road networks. Map Matching forces routes onto roads, distorting actual distance.

### 9.4 Local Database (SQLite) Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Journal Mode** | ☐ WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ DELETE (default, may cause UI jank) | |
| **Synchronous Mode** | ☐ `NORMAL` — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ `FULL` (safest, slower) | |
| | ☐ `OFF` (fastest, risk of corruption on crash) | |
| **Batch Insert Size** | ☐ 10-20 rows per transaction — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ 1 row per transaction (high I/O overhead) | |
| **Cache Size** | ☐ 2000 pages (≈8MB) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Default (2000 pages) | |

### 9.5 Mapbox SDK & Cost Optimization

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Primary SDK** | ☐ Maps SDK for Mobile (MAU-based) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Navigation SDK (Trip-based, expensive) | |
| **Navigation SDK Usage** | ☐ Not used (cost optimization) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Premium feature only (voice-guided runs) | |
| **Tile Type** | ☐ Vector Tiles — Recommended (smaller, zoomable) | ☐ |
| | ☐ Raster Tiles (larger, static quality) | |
| **Offline Tile Limit** | ☐ 6,000 tiles per device (free tier limit) | ☐ |
| | ☐ Custom limit (requires paid plan) | |
| **Offline Cache Strategy** | ☐ LRU (auto-delete oldest) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Manual management | |
| **Max Offline Zoom** | ☐ Zoom 15 — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Zoom 17 (more detail, larger download) | |

#### Cost Model Comparison

| SDK | Billing | Free Tier | Running App Fit |
|-----|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Maps SDK** | MAU (Monthly Active Users) | 50,000 MAU/month | ✅ Excellent |
| **Navigation SDK** | Per Trip | 1,000 trips/month | ⚠️ Only for premium features |

### 9.6 Data Synchronization Strategy ("The Final Sync")

> **Strategy**: NO real-time hex synchronization during runs. All data uploaded at run completion.

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Sync Timing** | ☐ Real-time (during run) | |
| | ☑ On run completion only ("The Final Sync") | ✅ |
| **Sync Engine** | ☑ Custom RPC Bulk Insert | ✅ |
| | ☐ PowerSync (auto-sync, simpler dev) | |
| | ☐ Standard REST API (inefficient for high-volume) | |
| **Bulk Insert RPC** | ☑ `finalize_run(jsonb)` function | ✅ |
| **Payload Contents** | ☑ endTime, distanceKm, hex_path[], yesterdayCrewCount | ✅ |
| **Compression** | ☑ Compress JSON payload (gzip) | ✅ |
| | ☐ No compression | |
| **Conflict Resolution** | ☑ Later `endTime` wins hex color | ✅ |
| **Offline Queue** | ☑ SQLite `sync_queue` table | ✅ |
| | ☐ In-memory only (data loss risk) | |

**Storage Optimization:**
- Raw GPS coordinates are NOT uploaded (only `hex_path`).
- `hex_path` = deduplicated list of H3 hex IDs passed.
- Estimated 90%+ reduction in storage compared to full GPS trace.

#### 9.6.1 Communication Lifecycle (Pre-patch Strategy)

> **Principle**: Minimize server calls during active running. Pre-load data on app launch, compute locally during run, batch upload on completion.

**App Launch (1 GET request)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GET /rpc/app_launch_sync                                   │

**Communication Summary**:

| Phase | Server Calls | Data Flow |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| App Launch | 1 GET | Server → Client (pre-patch) |
| OnResume (foreground) | 0-1 GET | Server → Client (conditional refresh) |
| Run Start | 0 | — |
| During Run | 0 | Local only |
| Run End | 1 POST | Client → Server (batch sync) |
| **Total per run** | **2 requests** | Minimal bandwidth |

**Offline Resilience**:
- If app launch fails: Use cached data from last session
- If finalize_run fails: Queue in SQLite `sync_queue` table
- Retry on next app launch or network restoration
- Never lose user's run data

**OnResume Data Refresh (Foreground Trigger)**:
- When app returns to foreground from background (iOS `applicationWillEnterForeground`, Android `onResume`):
  - Refresh hex map data for visible area
  - Update yesterday's multiplier (in case midnight passed)
  - Refresh crew info and ranking snapshot
- **Throttling**: Skip refresh if last refresh was < 30 seconds ago
- **During Active Run**: Skip refresh (avoid interrupting tracking)
- This ensures map data stays current even after extended background periods

## Changelog

### 2026-01-27 (Session 7)

**Fixed: Hex Map Flashing on Filter Change**

| # | Change | Type | Description |
|---|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | GeoJsonSource + FillLayer pattern | **버그수정/UX** | Migrated from PolygonAnnotationManager to GeoJsonSource for atomic hex updates |
| 2 | Data-driven styling via setStyleLayerProperty | **기술/Mapbox** | Bypasses FillLayer constructor's strict typing limitation for expression support |
| 3 | Landscape overflow fixes | **버그수정/UI** | Fixed overflow errors on landscape orientation across all screens |

**Technical Details:**
- `PolygonAnnotationManager.deleteAll()` + `createMulti()` caused visible flash
- Solution: Use `GeoJsonSource` with `FillLayer` for data-driven styling
- `mapbox_maps_flutter` FillLayer constructor expects `int?` for fillColor, not expression `List`
- Workaround: Create layer with placeholder values, then apply expressions via `setStyleLayerProperty()`

**Files Changed:**
- `lib/widgets/hexagon_map.dart` — Complete rewrite of hex rendering logic
- `lib/screens/running_screen.dart` — Landscape layout (OrientationBuilder)
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` — Reduced sizes in landscape
- `lib/screens/leaderboard_screen.dart` — Responsive podium heights
- `lib/screens/crew_screen.dart` — Responsive member grid
- `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` — Landscape adjustments
- `lib/screens/run_history_screen.dart` — Side-by-side layout in landscape

**Document Updates:**
- AGENTS.md: Added Mapbox Patterns section with GeoJsonSource + FillLayer documentation
- CLAUDE.md: Added Mapbox Patterns section with GeoJsonSource + FillLayer documentation

### 2026-01-26 (Session 6)

**Security & Fairness Enhancements:**

| # | Change | Type | Description |
|---|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Server-side points validation | **필수/보안** | Points cannot exceed hex_count × multiplier (anti-cheat) |
| 2 | Hex timestamp for conflict resolution | **필수/공정성** | Added `last_flipped_at` to hexes table; later run_endTime wins (prevents offline abusing) |
| 3 | OnResume data refresh | **필수/UX** | App refreshes map data when returning to foreground |
| 4 | Moving Average Pace (10 sec) | **권장/로직** | Changed from instantaneous pace to 10-second moving average (GPS noise smoothing) |

**Schema Changes:**
- Added `last_flipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to hexes table
- Updated `finalize_run()` to compare run_endTime with existing timestamp
- Added `p_client_points` parameter for server validation

**Document Updates:**
- §1: Updated key differentiators (server-verified, minimal timestamps)

### 2026-01-26 (Session 4)

**REMOVED: Daily Flip Limit**
- Deleted `daily_flips` table and `has_flipped_today()` function
- Removed `DailyHexFlipRecord` client model
- Same hex can now be flipped multiple times per day
- Simplifies logic and reduces database complexity

**Added: Table Separation (`runs` vs `run_history`)**
- `runs` table: Heavy data with `hex_path` → **DELETED on season reset**
- `run_history` table: Lightweight stats (date, distance, time, flips, points) → **PRESERVED across seasons**
- Personal run history now survives D-Day reset

**Updated: §4.2 Database Schema**
- Replaced `daily_flips` with `run_history` table
- Updated `finalize_run()` RPC to insert into `run_history`
- Updated partition management (run_history = permanent)

**Updated: §4.3 Partition Strategy**
- `runs`: Monthly partitions, seasonal (deleted on reset)
- `run_history`: Monthly partitions, permanent (never deleted)
- Removed `daily_flips` from partition table

**Updated: §4.4 Hot/Cold Data Strategy**
- New tier: "Seasonal" for `runs` (deleted on reset)
- New tier: "Permanent" for `run_history` and `daily_stats`

**Updated: §2.8 D-Day Reset Protocol**
- `runs` partitions dropped (heavy data)
- `run_history` preserved (lightweight stats)
- Updated SQL reset script

**Updated: Development Roadmap**
- Replaced "Daily hex flip dedup" with "Run history tracking"
- Updated pg_partman setup notes

### 2026-01-26 (Session 3)

**Updated: §2.5.3 Conflict Resolution ("Run-Level endTime")**
- Clarified that ALL hexagons in a run are assigned the run's `endTime`
- Example: User B (ends 11:00) beats User A (ends 10:00) for ALL their hexes, regardless of actual passage time
- Flip points calculated locally and uploaded as-is

**Updated: §2.6.1 Home Hex System (Asymmetric Definition)**
- Current user's home = FIRST hex (start point) — privacy protection
- Other users' home = LAST hex (end point) — standard behavior
- Privacy rationale: Don't reveal where you ended (potentially your actual home)

**Updated: §3.2.4 Running Screen**
- Replaced "Active Crew Runners" with "Yesterday's Crew Runners (어제 뛴 크루원)"

**Updated: §3.2.6 Run History Screen**
- Added timezone selector feature for displaying run history
- User can change timezone in history screen
- Stored locally, not synced to server

**Updated: §3.2.7 Crew Screen**
- Replaced "Active Status" with "Yesterday's Runners" badge
- Replaced "active runners count" with "yesterday's runner count"

**Removed: Crew run-start notifications**
