## 1. Project Overview

### Concept

A location-based running game that gamifies territory control through hexagonal maps.

- **Season**: Fixed **40 days**.
- **Reset**: On D-Day (D-0), all territories and scores are deleted (The Void). Only personal history remains.

### Core Philosophy

| Surface Layer | Hidden Layer |
|---------------|--------------|
| Red vs Blue competition | Connection through rivalry |
| Territory capture | Mutual respect growth |
| Weekly battles | Long-term relationships |
| "Win at all costs" | "We ran together" |

### Key Differentiators

- **Natural unity discovery** through competition phases
- **Team-Based Buff System**: Different buff mechanics per team (RED=Elite, BLUE=Union, PURPLE=Participation)
- **District Dominance**: Hex count determines District Leader status and buff bonuses
- **The Final Sync**: No real-time hex updates — batch upload at run completion (cost optimized)
- **Server-verified points**: Points calculated by client, validated by server (≤ hex_count × multiplier)
- **Privacy-first hex system**: Minimal timestamps for fairness (last_flipped_at), no runner IDs stored

---

## 2. Rule Definitions

### 2.1 Season & Time System

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Season Duration | 40 days (D-40 → D-0) |
| Server Timezone | GMT+2 (Israel Standard Time) |
| Season Start | Immediately after previous season ends |
| Purple Unlock | Available anytime during season |

**Rules:**
- The server operates on an absolute countdown. All users share the same timeline.
- Remaining days vary by entry point (e.g., joining at D-260 vs D-5).
- On D-0, all Flip Points, Buff data, and Rankings are wiped.
- Personal running history (Calendar/DailyStats) persists across seasons.
- No daily settlement cycle — points are calculated in real-time.

### 2.2 Teams & Factions

| Team | Code | Display Name | Emoji | Color | Base Multiplier |
|------|------|-------------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Red | `red` | FLAME | 🔥 | `#FF003C` | 1x |
| Blue | `blue` | WAVE | 🌊 | `#008DFF` | 1x |
| Purple | `purple` | CHAOS | 💜 | `#8B5CF6` | 1x |

**Rules:**
- On first entry, user MUST choose Red or Blue.
- Team choice is locked for the entire season.
- **Exception**: User can defect to Purple anytime (see §2.8).
- Purple is available anytime during the season.
- All teams have the same base multiplier (1x). Advantage comes from team-based buffs (see §2.3).

### 2.3 Team-Based Buff System

> **DEPRECATED**: The Crew System has been replaced by the Team-Based Buff System as of 2026-02-01.

#### 2.3.1 Buff Matrix Overview

Each team earns buff multipliers based on different mechanics:

| Team | Buff Basis | Max Multiplier |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| RED | Individual performance (Elite vs Common) + Territory | 4x (Elite) / 2x (Common) |
| BLUE | Territory dominance (District + Province) | 3x |
| PURPLE | District participation rate | 3x (no Province bonus) |

#### 2.3.2 RED Team Buffs (Elite System)

RED rewards **individual excellence** with territory bonuses.

| Scenario | Elite (Top 20%) | Common |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Normal (no territory wins) | 2x | 1x |
| District win only | 3x | 1x |
| Province win only | 3x | 2x |
| District + Province win | 4x | 2x |

**Definitions:**
- **Elite**: Top 20% of yesterday's **Flip Points** (points with multiplier applied, NOT raw flip count) among RED runners in the same District. Threshold stored in `daily_buff_stats.red_elite_threshold_points`, computed from `run_history.flip_points`.
- **Common**: Bottom 80% of RED runners in the District.
- **District Win**: RED controls the most hexes in this District (yesterday midnight snapshot).
- **Province Win**: RED controls the most hexes server-wide (yesterday midnight snapshot).

**Calculation Logic:**
- Elite Base: 2x
- Elite + District Win: +1x → 3x
- Elite + Province Win: +1x → 3x
- Elite + Both Wins: +1x + 1x → 4x
- Common Base: 1x
- Common + District Win: +0x → 1x (no district bonus for Common)
- Common + Province Win: +1x → 2x
- Common + Both Wins: +1x → 2x (no district bonus for Common)

#### 2.3.3 BLUE Team Buffs (Union System)

BLUE rewards **collective participation** with equal territory bonuses.

| Scenario | Union (All BLUE) |
|----------|------------------|
| Normal (no territory wins) | 1x |
| District win only | 2x |
| Province win only | 2x |
| District + Province win | 3x |

**Definitions:**
- **Union**: All BLUE users who ran yesterday in the same District benefit equally.
- **District Win**: BLUE controls the most hexes in this District (yesterday midnight snapshot).
- **Province Win**: BLUE controls the most hexes server-wide (yesterday midnight snapshot).

**Calculation Logic:**
- Union Base: 1x
- Union + District Win: +1x → 2x
- Union + Province Win: +1x → 2x
- Union + Both Wins: +1x + 1x → 3x

#### 2.3.4 PURPLE Team Buffs (Chaos System)

PURPLE rewards **participation rate** within District scope.

| Participation Rate (R) | Multiplier | Province Range Bonus |
|------------------------|------------|----------------------|
| R ≥ 60% | 3x | None |
| 30% ≤ R < 60% | 2x | None |
| R < 30% | 1x | None |

**Definitions:**
- **Participation Rate (R)**: Yesterday's PURPLE runners / Total PURPLE users in District.
- **No Province Range**: PURPLE does not receive server-wide dominance bonus.
- **District Leader status**: Does not affect PURPLE buff (same multiplier regardless).

**Examples:**
- 70% of District's PURPLE users ran yesterday = **3x**
- 45% participation = **2x**
- 20% participation = **1x**

#### 2.3.5 Buff Timing & Calculation

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Calculation Time | Daily at midnight (GMT+2) via Edge Function |
| Display Timing | Shown at run START (frozen for entire run) |
| Scope | District-level (determined by user's home hex) |
| Mid-day changes | Buff frozen at run start; new district = new buff next day |

**Rules:**
- Buff is **frozen** when a run starts. Mid-run location changes don't affect multiplier.
- Users see their buff breakdown before starting a run.
- Server-configurable thresholds via `app_config.buff_config`.

#### 2.3.6 Purple Defection (Unchanged)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Unlock Condition | Available anytime during season |
| Entry Cost | Points are **PRESERVED** (not reset) |
| Requirement | Permanent team change for remainder of season |

**Rules:**
- Only users who defect from Red/Blue can become Purple.
- Defection permanently changes team for the remainder of the season.
- No special requirements beyond being Red/Blue.

### 2.4 Hex Capture Mechanics

#### 2.4.1 Hex Grid Configuration

**Base Gameplay Resolution:**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| H3 Resolution | **9** (Base) |
| Avg Hex Edge Length | ~174m |
| Avg Hex Area | ~0.10 km² |
| Target Coverage | Block level (~170m radius) |

> All flip points are calculated at Resolution 9. This ensures equal point value for every hex regardless of geographic location.

**Geographic Scope Resolutions (for MapScreen & Leaderboard):**

| Scope | Enum | H3 Resolution | Avg Edge | Avg Area | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|----------|---------|
| ZONE | `zone` | 8 (Parent of 9) | ~461m | ~0.73 km² | Neighborhood leaderboard |
| DISTRICT | `district` | 6 (Parent of 9) | ~3.2km | ~36 km² | District leaderboard |
| PROVINCE | `province` | 4 (Parent of 9) | ~22.6km | ~1,770 km² | Metro/Regional leaderboard |

> H3 uses Aperture 7: each parent hex contains ~7 children. Scope filtering uses `cellToParent()` to group users by their parent hex at the scope resolution.

#### 2.4.2 Capture Rules

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Pace Threshold | < 8:00 min/km **moving average (last 20 sec)** |
| Speed Cap | < 25 km/h (anti-spoofing) |
| GPS Accuracy | Must be ≤ 50m to be valid |
| GPS Polling | Fixed 0.5 Hz (every 2 seconds) |
| Trigger | GPS coordinate enters hex boundary (immediate) |
| Color Logic | Hex displays color of LAST runner only |
| Stored Data | `lastRunnerTeam` + `last_flipped_at` (no runner ID) |

**Rules:**
- A hex changes color when a valid runner's GPS enters the hex boundary.
- "Valid runner" = **moving average pace (last 20 sec)** < 8:00 min/km AND speed < 25 km/h AND GPS accuracy ≤ 50m.
- **Moving Average Pace (20 sec)** = average pace over the last 20 seconds of movement.
  - At 0.5Hz GPS polling, provides ~10 samples for stable pace calculation.
  - Smooths out GPS noise and momentary speed fluctuations.
  - Prevents false captures from GPS jumps.
  - This means a runner can walk for 10 minutes, then jog for 20+ seconds to capture hexes.
- Purple runners paint hexes purple (regardless of original team before defection).
- No ownership mechanic — only "who ran here last".
- Accelerometer validation is required even in MVP (anti-spoofing).

#### 2.4.3 Flip Definition

A **Flip** occurs when a hex changes color (any color change counts).

| Transition | Is Flip? | Points? |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Neutral → Red | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Neutral → Blue | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Red → Blue | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Blue → Red | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Red → Purple | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Blue → Purple | ✅ Yes | +1 Flip Point |
| Red → Red (same team) | ❌ No | 0 |

**No streak bonus.** No flip caps of any kind (unlimited flips per day, different users can each flip the same hex independently; same user cannot re-flip own hex due to snapshot isolation).

### 2.5 Economy & Points

#### 2.5.1 Flip Points

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Earning Method | Flipping a hex (any color change) |
| Base Points Per Flip | 1 |
| Multiplier | Team-based buff (see §2.3) |
| Scope | Individual |
| Reset | Wiped on D-0 (season end) |

**Rules:**
- All Flip Points belong to the individual.
- Points are calculated at run completion ("The Final Sync").
- Multiplier is determined by team-based buff system (see §2.3).
- No streak bonuses. No daily total cap. **No daily hex limit** (different users can each flip the same hex independently; same user cannot re-flip own hex due to snapshot isolation).

#### 2.5.2 Team-Based Buff Multiplier

> **Design Goal**: Team-based competitive dynamics with different buff mechanics per team.

The buff multiplier is determined by team, performance tier, and territory dominance (see §2.3 for full details).

| Team | Condition | Multiplier Range |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| RED Elite | Base 2x + District Win (+1x) + Province Win (+1x) | 2x - 4x |
| RED Common | Base 1x + Province Win (+1x) | 1x - 2x |
| BLUE | Base 1x + District Win (+1x) + Province Win (+1x) | 1x - 3x |
| PURPLE | Participation Rate (R) | 1x - 3x |

**Rules:**
- Multiplier is calculated once daily at midnight (GMT+2) and fixed for the entire day.
- Users see their buff before starting a run (buff breakdown screen).
- Buff is **frozen** when run starts - no changes mid-run.
- **New users**: Default multiplier is **1x** until they have yesterday's data.
- **District determination**: User's home hex (first run location) determines their District scope.

**Advantages:**
- **Server efficiency**: Buff calculated once per day via Edge Function.
- **Predictability**: Users know their buff at the start of each day.
- **Strategy**: Teams can coordinate district dominance and participation.
- **Competition**: RED rewards individual excellence, BLUE rewards solidarity, PURPLE rewards district-wide consistency.

#### 2.5.3 Hex Snapshot System

> **Design Goal**: Deterministic flip point calculation. All users run against the same daily hex snapshot.

**Core Principle: Separation of Concerns**

| Concern | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Flip Points calculation | Yesterday's hex snapshot | Deterministic, same baseline for all users |
| Hex ownership tracking | Today's run activity (hex_path + end_time) | Builds tomorrow's snapshot at midnight |
| Map display | Snapshot + user's own today's runs (local overlay) | Visual feedback |

**Snapshot Lifecycle:**

```
[Midnight GMT+2 — Server builds snapshot via pg_cron]
  1. Start from yesterday's hex_snapshot (previous day's final state)
  2. Apply ALL today's synced runs (from `runs` table, filtered by end_time within today GMT+2)
  3. Conflict resolution: "Last run end-time wins" — later end_time determines hex color
  4. Write result to `hex_snapshot` table with snapshot_date = tomorrow
  5. This becomes tomorrow's "starting point" for all users
  6. Runs that end after midnight (cross-midnight runs) → affect next day's snapshot

[Client Prefetch — App Launch / OnResume / Pre-run]
  1. Download hex_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date = today (yesterday's midnight result)
  2. Load into HexRepository as base layer
  3. Apply local overlay: hexes flipped by THIS USER today (from local SQLite)
  4. Map screen shows: snapshot + own local flips
  5. Other users' today activity is INVISIBLE until tomorrow's snapshot

[During Run — Client-side flip counting]
  For each hex entered:
  1. Look up hex in HexRepository (snapshot + own local overlay)
  2. If hex color ≠ runner's team → FLIP (+1 point)
  3. If hex color = runner's team → NO FLIP
  4. If hex not in cache (neutral/absent from snapshot) → FLIP (+1 point)
  5. Update local overlay with new color
  6. Same hex can only flip once per run (session dedup)
  
  flip_points = total_flips × buff_multiplier (frozen at run start)

[Run Completion — "The Final Sync"]
  Client uploads:
    → hex_path[] (all hexes passed through)
    → flip_points (client-calculated)
    → buff_multiplier (frozen at run start)
    → end_time
  
  Server (finalize_run):
    → Validate: flip_points ≤ len(hex_path) × buff_multiplier (simple cap)
    → Award points: season_points += flip_points
    → Store hex_path + end_time in `runs` table (used at midnight for snapshot build)
    → Update `hexes` table for live buff/dominance calculations
    → INSERT INTO run_history (lightweight stats, preserved)
    → Do NOT modify hex_snapshot (immutable until midnight)
```

**Cross-Run Same-Day Behavior:**
- User runs at 9am → flips hex X (blue→red locally in overlay)
- User runs at 2pm → client has snapshot (blue) + local overlay (red from 9am)
- Hex X shows RED → same team → **no flip** (correct dedup)
- **Different users**: Both see snapshot (blue). Both can flip independently. Both earn points.

**Midnight-Crossing Runs:**
- Run starts 23:45 Feb 15, ends 00:30 Feb 16 (GMT+2)
- `end_time` = Feb 16 → hex_path goes into Feb 16's snapshot build
- Flip points use the buff frozen at run start (Feb 15's buff)

**Conflict Resolution Rule ("Later Run Wins" — Snapshot Build Only):**
- During midnight snapshot build, when multiple runs affect the same hex, the run with the latest `end_time` determines the hex color in the snapshot.
- This is for snapshot construction only — flip points are NOT recalculated.
- The `hexes` table (live state) also uses this rule for buff/dominance calculations.
- Flip points are always calculated by the client against the downloaded snapshot.

### 2.6 Pace Consistency (CV & Stability Score)

#### 2.6.1 Coefficient of Variation (CV)

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Purpose | Measure pace consistency during runs |
| Formula | `CV = (standard deviation / mean) × 100` of 1km lap paces |
| Denominator | Sample standard deviation (n-1) |
| Calculation | At run completion, from recorded lap data |
| Min Requirement | ≥ 1 km run (at least one complete lap) |
| Single Lap | Returns CV = 0 (no variance possible) |

**Lap Recording:**
- Laps are recorded automatically during runs
- Each lap = 1 kilometer of running
- Lap data: `lapNumber`, `distanceMeters`, `durationSeconds`, `startTimestampMs`, `endTimestampMs`
- Stored in local SQLite `laps` table

**CV Calculation (LapService):**
```dart
static double? calculateCV(List<LapModel> laps) {
  if (laps.isEmpty) return null;
  if (laps.length == 1) return 0.0;

  final paces = laps.map((lap) => lap.avgPaceSecPerKm).toList();
  final mean = paces.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / paces.length;
  
  // Sample standard deviation (n-1 denominator)
  final sumSquaredDiffs = paces.fold<double>(0, (sum, pace) => sum + pow(pace - mean, 2));
  final variance = sumSquaredDiffs / (paces.length - 1);
  final stdev = sqrt(variance);
  
  return (stdev / mean) * 100;
}
```

#### 2.6.2 Stability Score

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Formula | `Stability Score = 100 - CV` (clamped 0-100) |
| Interpretation | Higher = more consistent pace (better) |
| Display | Badge on leaderboard podium and rank tiles |
| Color Coding | Green (≥80), Yellow (50-79), Red (<50) |

**User Average CV:**
- Users accumulate an **average CV** across all qualifying runs
- Updated incrementally with each run via `finalize_run()` RPC
- Runs < 1km do not contribute to average CV

### 2.7 Ranking & Leaderboard

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Type | Season cumulative only (no daily/weekly) |
| Ranking Metric | Individual accumulated Flip Points |
| Team Buff Impact | Via team-based buff multipliers |
| Display | Top rankings (geographic scope removed for simplicity) based on user's "home hex" |
| Stability Badge | Shows user's stability score on podium and rank tiles |

#### 2.7.1 Home Hex System (Asymmetric Definition)

> **Design Goal**: Determine user's ranking scope based on their most recent running location, with privacy-preserving asymmetry.

**Home Hex Definition (Asymmetric):**

| User Type | Home Hex Definition | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Current User (self)** | **FIRST hexagon** of most recent run (start point) | Privacy: Don't reveal where you ended |
| **Other Users** | **LAST hexagon** of most recent run (end point) | Standard: Most recent location |

- The Home Hex is updated at run completion (part of "The Final Sync").
- Home Hex determines which zone/district/province scope the user belongs to for leaderboard filtering.
- **Privacy Rationale**: By using the START hex for yourself, your actual ending location (potentially your home) is not revealed to others viewing your ranking scope.
- **Zero-hex run**: If `hex_path` is empty (GPS failed, indoor run, etc.), **home hex is NOT updated**. Previous home hex values are preserved.

**Geographic Scope Filters (based on Home Hex):**

| Scope | Enum | H3 Resolution | Definition | Display |
|-------|------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **ZONE** | `zone` | 8 (Parent of 9) | Users whose Home Hex shares the same Resolution 8 parent | Neighborhood rankings (~461m radius) |
| **DISTRICT** | `district` | 6 (Parent of 9) | Users whose Home Hex shares the same Resolution 6 parent | District rankings (~3.2km radius) |
| **PROVINCE** | `province` | — | All users server-wide | Regional/Global rankings |

**Implementation:**
```dart
// Get user's home hex (asymmetric based on viewer)
String getHomeHex(RunSummary run, {required bool isSelf}) {
  final hexPath = run.hexPath;
  if (hexPath.isEmpty) return '';
  
  // Self sees START hex, others see END hex
  return isSelf ? hexPath.first : hexPath.last;
}

// Get user's scope hex from their home hex
String getHomeHexAtScope(String homeHex, GeographicScope scope) {
  return switch (scope) {
    GeographicScope.zone => h3.cellToParent(homeHex, 8),
    GeographicScope.district => h3.cellToParent(homeHex, 6),
    GeographicScope.province => null, // No filtering
  };
}
```

**Rules:**
- Leaderboard shows top users per selected scope based on shared parent hex.
- **Current user's scope** is determined by their own FIRST hex (start point).
- **Other users' scope** is determined by their LAST hex (end point).
- Users outside top ranks see their own rank in a sticky footer.
- Purple users have a distinct glowing border in the province view.
- Team filter tabs: [ALL] / [RED] / [BLUE] / [PURPLE].
- **Ranking snapshot**: Downloaded once on app launch, NOT polled in real-time.

### 2.8 Purple Team: Protocol of Chaos

#### 2.8.1 Unlock & Entry

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Availability | Anytime during season (no restriction) |
| Entry Name | "Traitor's Gate" |
| Entry Cost | Points **PRESERVED** (not reset) |
| Eligibility | Any Red/Blue user |

**Rules:**
- Purple is available anytime during the 40-day season.
- Once defected, cannot return to Red/Blue for the remainder of the season.
- No minimum Flip Point threshold to defect (anyone can defect).
- Defection is permanent for the remainder of the season.
- Points are preserved upon defection.

#### 2.8.2 Purple Mechanics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Buff Basis | District participation rate |
| Max Multiplier | 3x (no Province Range bonus) |
| Hex Color | Purple (distinct from Red/Blue) |
| Role | "Virus/Joker" — rewards consistent district-wide Purple participation |

### 2.9 D-Day Reset Protocol (The Void)

| Step | Action | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Season countdown reaches D-0 | Scheduled Edge Function |
| 2 | All hex colors reset to neutral | `TRUNCATE TABLE hexes` (instant) |
| 3 | All buff stats cleared | `TRUNCATE TABLE daily_buff_stats` (instant) |
| 4 | All Flip Points & team wiped | `UPDATE users SET season_points=0, team=NULL` |
| 5 | Drop season's `runs` partitions (heavy data) | `DROP TABLE runs_p20XX_XX` (instant disk reclaim) |
| 6 | `run_history` preserved | Personal run stats untouched |
| 7 | `daily_stats` preserved | Aggregated daily stats untouched |
| 8 | Next season begins immediately (D-40) | New season record created |
| 9 | All users must re-select Red or Blue | `team = NULL` forces re-selection |

**Data Preservation:**
- ✅ Kept: `run_history` (per-run stats), `daily_stats` (aggregated daily)
- ❌ Wiped: `runs` (heavy hex_path data), Flip Points, Buff stats, Rankings, Hex colors, Team
- ⚡ Deletion Method: `TRUNCATE`/`DROP PARTITION` = **$0 cost, < 1 second**, no performance impact

| District Boundaries | `district-boundary-source` | PROVINCE only | White, 3px, 12% opacity, 2px blur, dashed [4,3] |

**Province Boundary (PROVINCE scope):**
- Merged outer boundary of all ~7 district (Res 6) hexes — **irregular polygon** (NOT a single hexagon)
- Algorithm: Collect all directed edges → remove shared internal edges (opposite-direction cancel) → chain remaining outer edges into closed polygon
- Uses 7-decimal coordinate precision for edge matching (~1cm accuracy)

**District Boundaries (PROVINCE scope):**
- Individual dashed outlines for each ~7 district hex
- Hidden in DISTRICT and ZONE scopes

**DISTRICT scope:** Single district hex boundary (solid, same style as province)
**ZONE scope:** No boundaries shown

1. **Points** (primary/large display)
2. **Distance** (secondary)
3. **Pace** (secondary)
4. **Rank or Stability** (secondary)

Applies to: TeamScreen (yesterday stats), RunHistoryScreen (ALL TIME + period panels), LeaderboardScreen (season stats).

**Pace Format**: Unified across all screens — `X'XX` (apostrophe separator, no trailing `"`).
- Examples: `5'30`, `6'05`, `-'--` (for null/invalid)
- Applied in: `run_provider.dart`, `team_screen.dart`, `run_history_screen.dart`, `leaderboard_screen.dart`

**Google AdMob**: BannerAd displayed on MapScreen via `_NativeAdCard` widget.
- Shows on all scope views (zone, district, province)
- Shows in both portrait and landscape orientations
- `AdService` singleton manages SDK initialization (`lib/core/services/ad_service.dart`)
- Test ad unit IDs during development; replace with production IDs before release

## 4. Data Structure

### 4.1 Client Models

#### Team Enum

```dart
enum Team {
  red,    // Display: "FLAME" 🔥
  blue,   // Display: "WAVE" 🌊
  purple; // Display: "CHAOS" 💜

  String get displayName => switch (this) {
    red => 'FLAME',
    blue => 'WAVE',
    purple => 'CHAOS',
  };
}
```

#### UserModel

```dart
class UserModel {
  final String id;
  final String name;           // Display name
  final Team team;             // Current team (purple = defected)
  final String avatar;         // Emoji avatar (legacy, not displayed)
  final String sex;            // 'male', 'female', or 'other'
  final DateTime birthday;     // User birthday
  final int seasonPoints;      // Flip points this season (preserved on Purple defection)
  final String? manifesto;     // 30-char declaration, editable anytime
  final String? nationality;   // ISO country code (e.g., 'KR', 'US')
  final String? homeHex;       // First hex of last run (SELF leaderboard scope)
  final String? homeHexEnd;    // Last hex of last run (OTHERS leaderboard scope)
  final String? seasonHomeHex; // Home hex at season start
  final double totalDistanceKm; // Running season aggregate
  final double? avgPaceMinPerKm; // Weighted average pace (min/km)
  final double? avgCv;         // Average Coefficient of Variation (null if no CV data)
  final int totalRuns;         // Number of completed runs

  /// Stability score from average CV (higher = better, 0-100)
  int? get stabilityScore => avgCv == null ? null : (100 - avgCv!).round().clamp(0, 100);
}
```

**Aggregate Fields (incremental update via `finalize_run`):**
- `totalDistanceKm` → cumulative distance from all runs
- `avgPaceMinPerKm` → incremental average pace (updated on each run)
- `avgCv` → incremental average CV from runs with CV data (≥1km)
- `totalRuns` → count of completed runs

**Profile Fields (server-persisted, editable anytime):**
- `sex` → Male/Female/Other (displayed as ♂/♀/⚥ icon)
- `birthday` → user's date of birth
- `manifesto` → 30-character declaration (shown on leaderboard with electric effect)
- `nationality` → ISO country code (flag emoji display)

#### HexModel

```dart
class HexModel {
  final String id;             // H3 hex index (resolution 9)
  final LatLng center;         // Geographic center
  Team? lastRunnerTeam;        // null = neutral, else team color
  DateTime? lastFlippedAt;     // Run's endTime when hex was flipped (for conflict resolution)

  // NO runner IDs (privacy)

  /// Returns true if color actually changed (= a flip occurred)
  bool setRunnerColor(Team runnerTeam, DateTime runEndTime) {
    if (lastRunnerTeam == runnerTeam) return false;
    // Only update if this run ended later (conflict resolution)
    if (lastFlippedAt != null && runEndTime.isBefore(lastFlippedAt!)) return false;
    lastRunnerTeam = runnerTeam;
    lastFlippedAt = runEndTime;
    return true;
  }
}
```

#### Run (Unified Run Model — `lib/data/models/run.dart`)

> **Note**: The unified `Run` model replaces three legacy models: `RunSession` (active runs), `RunSummary` (completed runs), and `RunHistoryModel` (history display). A single model handles the full run lifecycle.

```dart
class Run {
  // Core fields
  final String id;
  final DateTime startTime;
  DateTime? endTime;
  double distanceMeters;
  int hexesPassed;
  int hexesColored;              // Flip count during this run
  Team teamAtRun;
  List<String> hexPath;          // H3 hex IDs passed (deduplicated)
  double buffMultiplier;         // Applied multiplier from buff system (frozen at run start)
  double? cv;                    // Coefficient of Variation (null for runs < 1km)
  String syncStatus;             // 'pending', 'synced', 'failed'

  // Computed getters
  double get distanceKm => distanceMeters / 1000;
  Duration get duration => (endTime ?? DateTime.now()).difference(startTime);
  double get avgPaceMinPerKm => /* calculation */;
  int? get stabilityScore => cv != null ? (100 - cv!).round().clamp(0, 100) : null;
  int get flipPoints => (hexesColored * buffMultiplier).round();

  // Mutable methods for active runs
  void addPoint(LocationPoint point) { ... }
  void updateDistance(double meters) { ... }
  void recordFlip() { ... }
  void complete() { ... }

  // Serialization
  Map<String, dynamic> toMap();    // SQLite (includes hex_path as comma-separated, buff_multiplier)
  Map<String, dynamic> toRow();    // Supabase
  factory Run.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map);  // SQLite
  factory Run.fromRow(Map<String, dynamic> row);  // Supabase
}
```

> **Storage Optimization**:
> - `hexPath` stores deduplicated H3 hex IDs only (no individual timestamps).
> - Raw GPS trace is NOT uploaded to server (stored locally in SQLite `routes` table for route display only).
> - Route shape can be reconstructed by connecting hex centers.
> - `endTime` is the sole timestamp used for conflict resolution.

> **Design Note**: `run_history` is separate from `runs` table.
> - `runs`: Heavy data with `hex_path` → **DELETED on season reset**
> - `run_history`: Lightweight stats → **PRESERVED across seasons** (5-year retention)

**Data Flow:**

| Stage | What Happens | Storage |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Active run | `Run` tracks GPS, hexes, distance in memory | In-memory |
| Run completion | `Run.complete()` → saved to SQLite + server sync | SQLite `runs` table |
| Server sync | `finalize_run()` RPC with hex_path, flip_points, buff_multiplier | Supabase `runs` + `run_history` |
| History display | `Run.fromMap()` from SQLite or `Run.fromRow()` from Supabase | Read-only |

#### DailyRunningStat (Aggregated — Preserved Across Seasons)

```dart
class DailyRunningStat {
  final String userId;
  final String dateKey;             // "2026-01-24" format
  final double totalDistanceKm;
  final int totalDurationSeconds;
  final double avgPaceMinPerKm;     // min/km (e.g., 6.0 = 6:00)
  final int flipCount;              // Total flips that day
}
```

#### LapModel (Per-km Lap Data)

```dart
/// Represents a single 1km lap during a run
class LapModel {
  final int lapNumber;         // which lap (1, 2, 3...)
  final double distanceMeters; // should be 1000.0 for complete laps
  final double durationSeconds; // time to complete this lap
  final int startTimestampMs;  // when lap started
  final int endTimestampMs;    // when lap ended

  /// Derived: average pace in seconds per kilometer
  double get avgPaceSecPerKm => durationSeconds / (distanceMeters / 1000);
}
```

**Purpose**: Used to calculate Coefficient of Variation (CV) for pace consistency analysis.

#### LocationPoint (Active GPS — Ephemeral)

```dart
class LocationPoint {
  final double latitude;
  final double longitude;
  final double altitude;
  final double speed;               // m/s
  final double accuracy;            // meters (must be ≤ 50m)
  final DateTime timestamp;
}
```

#### RoutePoint (Cold Storage — Compact)

```dart
class RoutePoint {
  final double lat;
  final double lng;
  // Minimal data for route replay (Douglas-Peucker compressed)
}
```

#### Partition Management (pg_partman)

```sql
-- Auto-create partitions for runs (monthly)
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  p_parent_table := 'public.runs',
  p_control := 'created_at',
  p_type := 'native',
  p_interval := '1 month',
  p_premake := 3
);

-- Auto-create partitions for daily_stats (monthly)
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  p_parent_table := 'public.daily_stats',
  p_control := 'created_at',
  p_type := 'native',
  p_interval := '1 month',
  p_premake := 3
);

-- Auto-create partitions for run_history (monthly, PERMANENT - never deleted)
SELECT partman.create_parent(
  p_parent_table := 'public.run_history',
  p_control := 'created_at',
  p_type := 'native',
  p_interval := '1 month',
  p_premake := 3
  -- NO p_retention: run_history is preserved across seasons
);
```

#### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Users can only read/update their own profile
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY users_self ON users
  USING (auth_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (auth_id = auth.uid());

-- Hexes are readable by all, writable by authenticated runners
ALTER TABLE hexes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY hexes_read ON hexes FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY hexes_write ON hexes FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Active runs: DEPRECATED - RLS policies removed
-- Table kept for potential future use but no RLS policies defined
-- ALTER TABLE active_runs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;  -- Disabled
```

#### Key Indexes

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_team ON users(team);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_season_points ON users(season_points DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_daily_stats_user_date ON daily_stats(user_id, date_key);
CREATE INDEX idx_hexes_team ON hexes(last_runner_team);
CREATE INDEX idx_daily_buff_stats_user_date ON daily_buff_stats(user_id, date);
```

```

**Design Principles:**
- `hex_snapshot`: Daily frozen hex state — basis for all flip point calculations. Immutable during the day.
- `hexes`: Live hex state for buff/dominance calculations. Updated by `finalize_run()`. NOT used for flip counting.
- `users`: Aggregate stats updated incrementally via `finalize_run()`.
- `runs`: Heavy data with `hex_path` (H3 IDs) → **DELETED on season reset**. Used at midnight to build next snapshot.
- `run_history`: Lightweight stats (distance, time, flips, cv) → **PRESERVED across seasons**.
- `daily_buff_stats`: Team-based buff multipliers (District Leader, Province Range) calculated daily at midnight GMT+2.
- **Snapshot-based flip counting**: Client counts flips against downloaded snapshot, server cap-validates only.
- **No daily flip limit**: Same hex can be flipped multiple times per day.
- **Multiplier**: Team-based buff via `calculate_daily_buffs()` at midnight GMT+2.
- **Sync**: No real-time — all hex data uploaded via `finalize_run()` at run completion.
- All security handled via RLS — **no separate backend API server needed**.

### 4.3 Data Lifecycle & Partitioning Strategy

#### Why Partitioning Matters

The 40-day season cycle means data accumulates and must be efficiently deleted. Traditional row-by-row DELETE is expensive and causes:
- Index fragmentation
- VACUUM overhead
- Performance degradation during reset

**Solution**: PostgreSQL table partitioning via `pg_partman`.

#### Partition Strategy by Table

| Table | Partition Interval | Retention | D-Day Reset Method |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `runs` | Monthly | Season data only | `DROP PARTITION` (instant) |
| `run_history` | Monthly | **5 years** (then auto-deleted) | Never deleted on D-Day |
| `daily_stats` | Monthly | **5 years** (then auto-deleted) | Never deleted on D-Day |
| `hexes` | Not partitioned | Season only | `TRUNCATE TABLE` (instant) |
| `daily_buff_stats` | Not partitioned | Season only | `TRUNCATE TABLE` (instant) |

**Data Retention Policy:**
- `run_history` and `daily_stats` are retained for **5 years** from creation date.
- pg_partman `p_retention` is set to `'5 years'` for these tables.
- Data older than 5 years is automatically dropped during partition maintenance.
- Account deletion triggers immediate deletion of all user data (GDPR compliance).

#### D-Day Reset Execution (The Void)

```sql
-- Season reset: executes in < 1 second regardless of data volume
BEGIN;
  -- 1. Instant wipes (TRUNCATE = instant, no row-by-row cost)
  TRUNCATE TABLE hexes;
  TRUNCATE TABLE daily_buff_stats;
  TRUNCATE TABLE daily_province_range_stats;
  
  -- 2. Reset user season data (UPDATE, not DELETE)
  UPDATE users SET
    season_points = 0,
    team = NULL,  -- Forces re-selection
    total_distance_km = 0,
    avg_pace_min_per_km = NULL,
    avg_cv = NULL,
    total_runs = 0,
    cv_run_count = 0;
  
  -- 3. Drop season's runs partitions (heavy data, instant disk reclaim)
  -- pg_partman handles this via retention policy, or manual:
  -- DROP TABLE runs_p2026_01, runs_p2026_02, ... ;
  
  -- 4. PRESERVED tables (personal history across seasons):
  --    - run_history (per-run lightweight stats)
  --    - daily_stats (aggregated daily stats)
COMMIT;
```

**Key Advantage over Firebase/Firestore:**
- Firebase charges per-document for deletion (100万 docs = 100万 write ops = ~$0.18+)
- Supabase/PostgreSQL: `TRUNCATE`/`DROP PARTITION` = **$0, instant, no performance impact**

#### Two Data Domains (Critical Architecture Rule)

All data in the app belongs to exactly one of two domains:

**Domain 1: Snapshot (Server → Local, read-only until next midnight)**
- Downloaded on app launch / OnResume via prefetch
- Created by server at midnight GMT+2 from all runners' uploaded data
- **NEVER changes from running** — frozen until next prefetch
- **Always anchored to home hex** — `PrefetchService` downloads using `homeHex`/`homeHexAll` (never GPS)

| Data | Source | Used By |
|------|--------|---------|
| Hex map (base layer) | `hex_snapshot` table | MapScreen |
| Leaderboard rankings + season record | `get_leaderboard` RPC → `season_leaderboard_snapshot` (NOT live `users`) | LeaderboardScreen |
| Team rankings / dominance | `get_team_rankings` / `get_hex_dominance` RPC | TeamScreen |
| Buff multiplier | `get_user_buff` RPC (yesterday's data) | BuffService (frozen at run start) |
| User aggregates | `app_launch_sync` → `UserModel` | ALL TIME stats, profile |

**Domain 2: Live (Local creation → Upload to server)**
- Created by user's running actions
- Changes during/after each run
- Uploaded to server via "The Final Sync"

| Data | Source | Used By |
|------|--------|---------|
| Header FlipPoints | `PointsService` (server season_points + local unsynced) | FlipPointsWidget |
| Run records | Local SQLite (created per run) | RunHistoryScreen (recent runs, period stats) |
| Hex overlay (own runs) | Local SQLite + HexRepository | MapScreen (own flips on top of snapshot) |

**Rules:**
1. `PointsService.totalSeasonPoints` is the ONLY hybrid value (server + local unsynced)
2. ALL TIME stats use server `UserModel` aggregates + `totalSeasonPoints` for points
3. Period stats (DAY/WEEK/MONTH/YEAR) use local SQLite runs (run-level granularity)
4. TeamScreen and LeaderboardScreen use ONLY snapshot domain — never compute from local runs
5. Server processes all runners' uploads at midnight to create next day's snapshot
6. LeaderboardScreen Season Record stats (points, distance, pace) come from snapshot `LeaderboardEntry`, NOT live `currentUser`
7. `get_leaderboard` RPC reads from `season_leaderboard_snapshot` table, NOT from live `users` table
8. Snapshot downloads always use **home hex** — MapScreen uses **GPS hex** for display only when outside province

#### Location Domain Separation (Home vs GPS)

Server data and map display use different location anchors. This prevents server data from changing when the user travels.

| Concern | Location Anchor | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Hex snapshot download | **Home hex** | `PrefetchService._homeHexAll` in `_downloadHexData()` |
| Leaderboard filtering | **Home hex** | `LeaderboardProvider.filterByScope()` reads `_prefetchService.homeHex` |
| TeamScreen territory/city | **Home hex** | `PrefetchService().homeHexCity` / `homeHex` |
| Season register location | **Home hex** | `PrefetchService().homeHex` |
| MapScreen camera centering | **GPS hex** (outside province) | `PrefetchService().gpsHex` via `isOutsideHomeProvince` |
| MapScreen territory overlay | **GPS hex** (outside province) | `_TeamStatsOverlay` uses `gpsHex` for display hex |
| HexagonMap anchor hex | **GPS hex** (outside province) | `_updateHexagons()` anchors to `gpsHex` when outside |
| Hex capture | **Disabled** outside province | `_OutsideProvinceBanner` on MapScreen |

**PrefetchService getters** (no `activeHex*` — those were removed to prevent domain conflation):
- `homeHex`, `homeHexCity`, `homeHexAll` — registered home location (server data anchor)
- `gpsHex`, `getGpsHexAtScope()` — current GPS position (map display only)
- `isOutsideHomeProvince` — GPS province ≠ home province

**Outside-province UX**:
- MapScreen: `_OutsideProvinceBanner` (glassmorphism floating card) directs user to Profile to update location
- ProfileScreen: `_LocationCard` shows both registered home and GPS location with "UPDATE TO CURRENT" button
- Update dialog shows FROM→TO locations with buff reset warning

#### Data Flow Summary

```
[Client Prefetch — App Launch / OnResume]
  Download hex_snapshot WHERE snapshot_date = today (yesterday's midnight result)
  Download leaderboard, team rankings, buff multiplier, user aggregates
  Apply local overlay: user's own today's flips (from local SQLite)
  Map shows: snapshot + own local flips (other users' today activity invisible)

[During Run - Local Only]
  Runner GPS → Client validates → Local hex_path list
  Flip counted against snapshot + local overlay (NOT live server state)
  flip_points = total_flips × buff_multiplier (frozen at run start)
  Header FlipPoints updates live: PointsService.addRunPoints()
  NO server communication (battery + cost optimization)

[Run Completion - "The Final Sync"]
  Client uploads: { startTime, endTime, distanceKm, hex_path[], flip_points, buff_multiplier, cv }
  Server RPC: finalize_run() →
    → Cap validate: flip_points ≤ len(hex_path) × buff_multiplier
    → Award capped points: season_points += flip_points
    → Update user aggregates: total_distance_km, avg_pace, avg_cv, total_runs
    → Update live `hexes` table (for buff/dominance, NOT for flip counting)
    → INSERT INTO run_history (lightweight stats, preserved)
    → hex_snapshot NOT modified (immutable until midnight)
  PointsService.onRunSynced() transfers local unsynced → server baseline

[Daily Maintenance — pg_cron (midnight GMT+2)]
  build_daily_hex_snapshot() →
    → Start from yesterday's hex_snapshot
    → Apply all today's runs (end_time within today GMT+2)
    → Conflict: "last run end-time wins" hex color
    → Write to hex_snapshot with snapshot_date = tomorrow
  calculate_daily_buffs() →
    → Calculate team-based buffs for all active users
    → Uses live `hexes` table for dominance data
    → INSERT INTO daily_buff_stats

[D-Day - Reset Path]
  TRUNCATE hexes, hex_snapshot, daily_buff_stats (instant)
  UPDATE users (reset points/team/aggregates)
  DROP runs partitions (heavy data, instant disk reclaim)
  run_history PRESERVED (per-run stats)
  daily_stats PRESERVED (aggregated stats)
```

### 4.4 Hot vs Cold Data Strategy

| Tier | Data | Storage | Retention | Reset Behavior |
|------|------|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **Hot** | Hex map, Active runs | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Current season | TRUNCATE (instant) |
| **Seasonal** | `runs` (heavy with hex_path) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Current season | DROP PARTITION (instant) |
| **Permanent** | `run_history` (lightweight stats) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | **Forever** | Never deleted |
| **Permanent** | `daily_stats` (aggregated daily) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | **Forever** | Never deleted |
| **Cold** | Raw GPS paths | Local SQLite only (`routes`) | Device lifetime | Never uploaded to server (90%+ server storage savings) |

> **Key Design**: Separate `runs` (heavy, deleted) from `run_history` (light, preserved).
> Raw GPS coordinates are stored locally only (SQLite `routes` table for route display). Only `hex_path` (H3 IDs) is uploaded to server in `runs`.

**Snapshot-Based Points Flow ("The Final Sync"):**

```
[Run Completion - Client uploads run data]
  Server RPC: finalize_run(hex_path[], flip_points, buff_multiplier, ...)
    → Cap validate: flip_points ≤ len(hex_path) × buff_multiplier
    → Award capped points: season_points += flip_points
    → Update live hexes table (for buff/dominance only)
    → hex_snapshot NOT modified (immutable until midnight)
    → INSERT INTO run_history (lightweight stats, preserved)
```

> **Note**: Client counts flips against daily snapshot. Server does NOT re-count flips.
> No daily flip limit. Same hex can be flipped multiple times per day.

**Supabase Realtime Integration (Minimal Scope):**
- **NO real-time features currently required** — all data synced on app launch and run completion
- `hexes` and `users.season_points` → NO real-time broadcast (poll on app foreground)
- **Cost Optimization**: Eliminated ALL WebSocket usage for maximum cost savings
- Future consideration: May add real-time for social features if needed later

### 4.5 Local Storage (SQLite)

| Table | Purpose | Sync Strategy |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `runs` | Offline run data (active session) | Upload to Supabase on connectivity |
| `routes` | GPS points during active run | Compress → Supabase Storage on completion |
| `laps` | Per-km lap data for CV calculation | Local only, used for CV computation |
| `run_history` | Local cache of run history | Pull from Supabase |
| `daily_stats` | Local cache of daily stats | Pull from Supabase |
| `hex_cache` | Nearby hex data for offline | Cache visible + surrounding hexes |
| `run_checkpoint` | Crash recovery checkpoint | Local only, cleared after run save |

**Schema v12 (Current):**
```sql
-- runs table includes sync retry fields:
hex_path TEXT DEFAULT ''         -- Comma-separated hex IDs (for sync retry)
buff_multiplier INTEGER DEFAULT 1 -- Buff at run time (for sync retry)
cv REAL                          -- Coefficient of Variation (null for runs < 1km)
sync_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' -- 'pending', 'synced', 'failed'
flip_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0    -- Points earned (hexes × multiplier)
run_date TEXT                    -- GMT+2 date string for today's points

-- Laps table (per-km data for CV):
CREATE TABLE laps (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  runId TEXT NOT NULL,
  lapNumber INTEGER NOT NULL,
  distanceMeters REAL NOT NULL,
  durationSeconds REAL NOT NULL,
  startTimestampMs INTEGER NOT NULL,
  endTimestampMs INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (runId) REFERENCES runs (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
CREATE INDEX idx_laps_runId ON laps(runId);

-- Run checkpoint table (crash recovery):
CREATE TABLE run_checkpoint (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 'active',
  run_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  team_at_run TEXT NOT NULL,
  start_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
  distance_meters REAL NOT NULL,
  hexes_colored INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  captured_hex_ids TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  buff_multiplier INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  last_updated INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## 5. Tech Stack & Architecture

### 5.1 Backend Platform Decision

#### Why Supabase over Firebase

| Criterion | Firebase (Firestore) | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Winner |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Data Model** | NoSQL (Document) | Relational (SQL) | Supabase — user/team/season relationships require JOINs |
| **Query Complexity** | Limited (no JOINs, no aggregation) | Full SQL (JOIN, GROUP BY, SUM, Window functions) | Supabase — leaderboard & multiplier calculations |
| **Cost Model** | Per-read/write operation | Instance-based (flat rate) | Supabase — no per-operation billing explosion at scale |
| **Mass Deletion (D-Day)** | Per-document write cost ($0.18/1M deletes) | TRUNCATE/DROP = $0, instant | Supabase — critical for 40-day reset |
| **Real-time** | Firestore listeners | Supabase Realtime (WebSocket) | Tie |
| **Security** | Firebase Rules (custom DSL) | Row Level Security (SQL policies) | Supabase — standard SQL, no custom language |
| **Backend API** | Requires Cloud Functions for complex logic | RLS + Edge Functions (optional) | Supabase — no separate API server needed |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Google-proprietary | Open-source (PostgreSQL) | Supabase — can self-host if needed |
| **Scaling** | Auto-scales (but cost scales too) | Predictable instance pricing | Supabase — budget-friendly at scale |

**Decision**: **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** as primary backend.

```

**Key Serverless Properties:**
- No backend API server to maintain
- RLS handles all authorization at DB level
- Edge Functions only for scheduled tasks (D-Day reset, partition management, daily multiplier calculation)
- **NO Realtime/WebSocket** — all data synced via REST on app launch and run completion
- Supabase Storage for cold GPS data (replaces AWS S3)

## 8. Appendix

### A. User Identity Rules

| State | Avatar Display | Leaderboard Name |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Red/Blue user | Personal avatar | User name |
| Defected to Purple | Personal avatar | User name |

### B. Team-Based Buff Multiplier Examples

| Team | Scenario | Multiplier | Flip Points per Flip |
|------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| RED | Elite (Top 20%) + District Leader + Province Range | 4x | 4 |
| RED | Elite + District Leader (no Province Range) | 3x | 3 |
| RED | Elite (non-leader district) | 2x | 2 |
| RED | Common (any district) | 1x | 1 |
| BLUE | District Leader + Province Range | 3x | 3 |
| BLUE | District Leader (no Province Range) | 2x | 2 |
| BLUE | Non-leader district | 1x | 1 |
| PURPLE | ≥60% district participation | 3x | 3 |
| PURPLE | 30-59% district participation | 2x | 2 |
| PURPLE | <30% district participation | 1x | 1 |
| Any | New user (no yesterday data) | 1x | 1 |

**Key Points:**
- Multiplier is calculated at midnight (GMT+2), fixed for the entire day.
- Buff is **frozen** when run starts — no changes mid-run.
- Server calculates once per day via Edge Function.
- District scope determined by user's home hex.

### C. Leaderboard Geographic Scope

Geographic scope filtering uses H3's hierarchical parent cell system. Users are grouped by their parent hex ID at the scope's resolution level.

**Implementation (lib/core/config/h3_config.dart):**

| Scope | H3 Resolution | Map Zoom | Filter Logic |
|-------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| **ZONE** | 8 | 15.0 | `cellToParent(userHex, 8)` — Neighborhood (~461m) |
| **DISTRICT** | 6 | 12.0 | `cellToParent(userHex, 6)` — District (~3.2km) |
| **PROVINCE** | 4 | 10.0 | No filter — server-wide ranking |

**Client Flow:**
1. Get user's current base hex (Resolution 9)
2. Convert to scope resolution via `getScopeHexId(baseHex, scope)`
3. Query Supabase RPC with scope hex ID to filter rankings

**Approximate Coverage:**
- ZONE (Res 8): ~7 base hexes, neighborhood-level competition
- DISTRICT (Res 6): ~343 base hexes, district-level competition
- PROVINCE (Res 4): ~16,807 base hexes, metro-wide competition

### D. Slogans

**Korean:**
- "같은 땀, 다른 색" (Same sweat, different colors)
- "우리는 반대로 달려 만났다" (We ran apart, met together)
- "배신은 새로운 시작이다" (Betrayal is a new beginning)

**English:**
- "Run Apart, Meet Together"
- "Same Path, Different Colors"
- "Embrace the Chaos"

### E. Changelog

| Date | Change |

| | — Google AdMob integration: `AdService` singleton, BannerAd on MapScreen (all scope views, portrait + landscape) |
| | — Stat panel display order unified: points (primary) → distance → pace → rank/stability (TeamScreen, RunHistoryScreen, LeaderboardScreen) |
| | — Pace format unified: `X'XX` (apostrophe, no trailing `"`). Applied to run_provider, team_screen, run_history_screen, leaderboard_screen |
| | — FlipPoints header widget: shows season total points (not today's); `FittedBox` overflow prevention for 3+ digits |
| | — Landscape layout fixes: ad in MapScreen landscape, leaderboard `CustomScrollView` for full scrollability |
| | — Geographic scope category naming: zone/city/all → zone/district/province in all documentation |
| | — New file: `lib/services/ad_service.dart` |
| | — New dependency: `google_mobile_ads: ^5.3.0` |
| | — Platform configs: iOS `GADApplicationIdentifier` in Info.plist, Android `APPLICATION_ID` in AndroidManifest.xml |
| 2026-02-16 | **Province Boundary, Profile Redesign, Electric Manifesto**: |
| | — Province boundary: merged outer polygon of ~7 district hexes (irregular shape, not a single hexagon) |
| | — Added `_computeMergedOuterBoundary()` algorithm: directed edge collection → shared edge removal → polygon chaining |
| | — District boundaries: individual dashed outlines in ALL scope view |
| | — Profile screen redesign: added sex (♂/♀/⚥), birthday, nationality (flag emoji); removed avatar display |
| | — Manifesto limit: 12 → 30 characters; server-persisted via Supabase |
| | — Leaderboard electric manifesto: `ShaderMask` + animated `LinearGradient` (3s cycle, team-colored glow) |
| | — Unified `Run` model (`run.dart`) replaces `RunSession`, `RunSummary`, `RunHistoryModel` |
| | — Dummy test data: 4 days of realistic runs seeded (Feb 11-14), 49 red hexes |
| | — Repository pattern: `UserRepository`, `HexRepository`, `LeaderboardRepository` as single source of truth |
| | — SQLite v12: added `hex_path`, `buff_multiplier` to runs; added `run_checkpoint` table (crash recovery) |
| | — Various bug fixes: season record stale pace, sex icon overflow, type safety (dynamic → UserModel) |
| 2026-02-15 | **Snapshot-Based Flip Points System**: |
| | — Replaced live-state flip counting with daily hex snapshot model |
| | — New `hex_snapshot` table: frozen daily at midnight GMT+2 |
| | — Client counts flips against snapshot, server cap-validates only |
| | — `finalize_run` accepts client flip_points (no server-side recount) |
| | — `build_daily_hex_snapshot()` cron job builds tomorrow's snapshot at midnight |
| | — Map shows snapshot + user's own local flips (other users invisible until tomorrow) |
| | — Cross-midnight runs: end_time determines which day's snapshot they affect |

| | — Moving average window: 10s → 20s (~10 samples at 0.5Hz for stable pace calculation) |
| | — Min time between points: 100ms → 1500ms (allows 0.5Hz with margin) |
| | — Pace validation now uses 20-second moving average instead of 10-second |
| 2026-01-26 | **Session 4 - Data Architecture**: |
| | — Daily flip limit REMOVED — different users can each flip the same hex independently (same user cannot re-flip own hex due to snapshot isolation) |
| | — Table separation: `runs` (heavy, seasonal) vs `run_history` (light, permanent) |
| | — `daily_flips` table and `has_flipped_today()` function removed |
| | — D-Day reset now preserves `run_history` (personal run stats survive) |
| 2026-01-26 | **Session 3 - Design Refinements**: |
| | — Conflict Resolution: "Run-Level endTime" — ALL hexes get run's endTime, not individual passage times |
| | — Home Hex Asymmetric: Self=FIRST hex (start), Others=LAST hex (end) for privacy |
| | — UI: "Yesterday's Crew Runners (어제 뛴 크루원)" replaces "Active Crew Runners" |

| **FLPC Priority** | ☐ `PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY` (GPS always on) | |
| | ☑ `PRIORITY_BALANCED_POWER_ACCURACY` (battery saving) | ✅ |

#### 9.1.2 iOS Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Background Mode** | ☑ `UIBackgroundModes: location` (Required) | ✅ |
| **Pause Updates Automatically** | ☑ `pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically = false` — Required | ✅ |
| | ☐ `true` (iOS may stop tracking when stationary — NOT recommended) | |
| **Activity Type** | ☑ `CLActivityType.fitness` | ✅ |
| | ☐ `CLActivityType.other` | |
| **Desired Accuracy** | ☐ `kCLLocationAccuracyBest` | |
| | ☐ `kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters` | |
| | ☑ `kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters` (battery saving, matches 50m rule) | ✅ |
| **Distance Filter** | ☑ 5 meters (battery optimization) | ✅ |

### 9.2 GPS Polling & Battery Optimization

> **Strategy**: Battery efficiency is prioritized over data precision. Fixed 0.5Hz polling with 20-second moving average window compensates for lower sample rates.

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Polling Strategy** | ☐ Adaptive Polling (variable rate based on speed) | |
| | ☑ Fixed 0.5 Hz (every 2 seconds) — battery saving, consistent behavior | ✅ |
| **Moving Average Window** | ☐ 10 seconds (~5 samples at 0.5Hz — unstable) | |
| | ☑ 20 seconds (~10 samples at 0.5Hz — stable) | ✅ |
| **Min Time Between Points** | ☐ 100ms (allows up to 10Hz) | |
| | ☑ 1500ms (allows 0.5Hz with margin) | ✅ |
| **Distance Filter (iOS)** | ☑ 5 meters — Required for battery optimization | ✅ |

| | ☐ `kCLDistanceFilterNone` (all updates — high battery) | |
| **Batch Buffer Size** | ☐ 10 points (write every ~20 seconds at 0.5Hz) | |
| | ☑ 20 points (write every ~40 seconds at 0.5Hz) — fewer I/O ops | ✅ |
| | ☐ 1 point (immediate write — high I/O) | |

### 9.3 Signal Processing & Noise Reduction

> **Strategy**: Use Kalman Filter to smooth hardware noise. NO Map Matching API (cost + trail accuracy).

#### 9.3.1 Kalman Filter Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Kalman Filter** | ☑ Enabled | ✅ |
| | ☐ Disabled (raw GPS only) | |
| **State Variables** | ☑ 2D (lat/lng + velocity) | ✅ |
| | ☐ 3D (lat/lng/altitude + velocity) | |
| **Dynamic Noise Covariance** | ☑ Use GPS `accuracy` field dynamically | ✅ |
| | ☐ Fixed noise covariance | |
| **Outlier Rejection Speed** | ☐ 44 m/s (≈100 mph, Usain Bolt = 12.4 m/s) | |
| | ☑ 25 m/s (≈56 mph, matches speed cap rule) | ✅ |
| | ☐ 15 m/s (≈34 mph, very strict) | |

#### 9.3.2 Map Matching Strategy

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Real-time Display** | ☑ Smoothed Raw Trace (Kalman filtered) | ✅ |
| | ☐ Mapbox Map Matching API (snaps to roads) | |
| **Post-run Display** | ☑ Same as real-time | ✅ |
| | ☐ Mapbox Map Matching API (prettier for sharing) | |
| **Map Matching API Usage** | ☑ Never (cost optimization) | ✅ |
| | ☐ Optional for post-run sharing only | |
| | ☐ Always (higher cost, road-snapped routes) | |

> **Note**: Running apps should NOT use Map Matching by default. Runners often use parks, trails, and tracks that aren't on road networks. Map Matching forces routes onto roads, distorting actual distance.

### 9.4 Local Database (SQLite) Configuration

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Journal Mode** | ☐ WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ DELETE (default, may cause UI jank) | |
| **Synchronous Mode** | ☐ `NORMAL` — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ `FULL` (safest, slower) | |
| | ☐ `OFF` (fastest, risk of corruption on crash) | |
| **Batch Insert Size** | ☐ 10-20 rows per transaction — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ 1 row per transaction (high I/O overhead) | |
| **Cache Size** | ☐ 2000 pages (≈8MB) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Default (2000 pages) | |

### 9.5 Mapbox SDK & Cost Optimization

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Primary SDK** | ☐ Maps SDK for Mobile (MAU-based) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Navigation SDK (Trip-based, expensive) | |
| **Navigation SDK Usage** | ☐ Not used (cost optimization) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Premium feature only (voice-guided runs) | |
| **Tile Type** | ☐ Vector Tiles — Recommended (smaller, zoomable) | ☐ |
| | ☐ Raster Tiles (larger, static quality) | |
| **Offline Tile Limit** | ☐ 6,000 tiles per device (free tier limit) | ☐ |
| | ☐ Custom limit (requires paid plan) | |
| **Offline Cache Strategy** | ☐ LRU (auto-delete oldest) — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Manual management | |
| **Max Offline Zoom** | ☐ Zoom 15 — Recommended | ☐ |
| | ☐ Zoom 17 (more detail, larger download) | |

#### Cost Model Comparison

| SDK | Billing | Free Tier | Running App Fit |
|-----|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Maps SDK** | MAU (Monthly Active Users) | 50,000 MAU/month | ✅ Excellent |
| **Navigation SDK** | Per Trip | 1,000 trips/month | ⚠️ Only for premium features |

### 9.6 Data Synchronization Strategy ("The Final Sync")

> **Strategy**: NO real-time hex synchronization during runs. All data uploaded at run completion.

| Setting | Options | Selected |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Sync Timing** | ☐ Real-time (during run) | |
| | ☑ On run completion only ("The Final Sync") | ✅ |
| **Sync Engine** | ☑ Custom RPC Bulk Insert | ✅ |
| | ☐ PowerSync (auto-sync, simpler dev) | |
| | ☐ Standard REST API (inefficient for high-volume) | |
| **Bulk Insert RPC** | ☑ `finalize_run(jsonb)` function | ✅ |
| **Payload Contents** | ☑ endTime, distanceKm, hex_path[], buffMultiplier | ✅ |
| **Compression** | ☑ Compress JSON payload (gzip) | ✅ |
| | ☐ No compression | |
| **Conflict Resolution** | ☑ Later `endTime` wins hex color | ✅ |
| **Offline Queue** | ☑ SQLite `sync_queue` table | ✅ |
| | ☐ In-memory only (data loss risk) | |

**Storage Optimization:**
- Raw GPS coordinates are NOT uploaded to server (stored locally in SQLite `routes` table for route display; only `hex_path` uploaded).
- `hex_path` = deduplicated list of H3 hex IDs passed.
- Estimated 90%+ reduction in storage compared to full GPS trace.

#### 9.6.1 Communication Lifecycle (Pre-patch Strategy)

> **Principle**: Minimize server calls during active running. Pre-load data on app launch, compute locally during run, batch upload on completion.

**App Launch (1 GET request)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  GET /rpc/app_launch_sync                                   │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Returns:                                                   │
│  1. hex_map[]        - Latest hexagon colors (visible area) │
│  2. ranking_snapshot - Leaderboard data (Province/District/Zone) │
│  3. buff_multiplier  - Today's team-based buff (from daily) │
│  4. user_stats       - Personal season points, home_hex     │
│  5. app_config       - Server-configurable constants        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Running Start**: **No communication** (skip entirely)
- All required data already pre-patched
- User can start running immediately
- Zero latency, zero server dependency

**During Running** (0 server calls):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LOCAL COMPUTATION ONLY                                     │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  1. Hex display      → Use pre-patched hex_map data         │
│  2. Hex detection    → Local H3 library (geoToCell)         │
│  3. Flip detection   → Compare runner team vs hex color     │
│  4. Points calc      → Local: flips × yesterday_multiplier  │
│  5. Distance/Pace    → Local Haversine formula              │
│  6. Route recording  → Local SQLite (ring buffer)           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Run Completion (1 POST request)**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  POST /rpc/finalize_run                                     │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Payload:                                                   │
│  {                                                          │
│    "run_id": "uuid",                                        │
│    "start_time": "2026-01-26T19:00:00+09:00",              │
│    "end_time": "2026-01-26T19:30:00+09:00",                 │
│    "distance_km": 5.2,                                      │
│    "duration_seconds": 1800,                                │
│    "hex_path": ["8f28308280fffff", "8f28308281fffff", ...], │
│    "cv": 8.5                               // Optional      │
│  }                                                          │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Server actions:                                            │
│  1. Fetch buff_multiplier from daily_buff_stats             │
│  2. Update hex colors (ALL hexes get run's endTime)         │
│  3. Calculate final points (server-side verification)       │
│  4. Store start_hex (first) and end_hex (last) for home     │
│  5. Update user aggregates (distance, pace, cv)             │
│  6. Return updated user_stats                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Communication Summary**:

| Phase | Server Calls | Data Flow |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| App Launch | 1 GET | Server → Client (pre-patch) |
| OnResume (foreground) | 0-1 GET | Server → Client (conditional refresh) |
| Run Start | 0 | — |
| During Run | 0 | Local only |
| Run End | 1 POST | Client → Server (batch sync) |
| **Total per run** | **2 requests** | Minimal bandwidth |

**Offline Resilience**:
- If app launch fails: Use cached data from last session
- If finalize_run fails: Run stays `'pending'` in SQLite `runs` table (with hex_path + buff_multiplier stored for retry)
- `SyncRetryService` checks connectivity via `connectivity_plus` before retrying
- Retry triggers: app launch, OnResume, after next run completion
- Never lose user's run data
- **Crash Recovery**: `run_checkpoint` table saves state on each hex flip; recovered on next app launch

**OnResume Data Refresh (Foreground Trigger)**:
- When app returns to foreground from background (iOS `applicationWillEnterForeground`, Android `onResume`):
  - Refresh hex map data for visible area (PrefetchService.refresh)
  - Refresh leaderboard data
  - Retry failed syncs (SyncRetryService.retryUnsyncedRuns)
  - Refresh buff multiplier via BuffService.refresh (in case midnight passed)
  - Refresh today's points baseline via appLaunchSync + PointsService
- **Throttling**: Skip refresh if last refresh was < 30 seconds ago
- **During Active Run**: Skip refresh (avoid interrupting tracking)
- This ensures map data stays current even after extended background periods

### 9.12 Remote Configuration System

> **Strategy**: All 50+ game constants are server-configurable via Supabase, with local caching and graceful fallback to hardcoded defaults.

#### 9.12.1 Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    RemoteConfigService                       │
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────────────┐ │
│  │   Server    │→ │   Cache     │→ │   Defaults          │ │
│  │ (Supabase)  │  │ (JSON file) │  │ (AppConfig.defaults)│ │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └─────────────────────┘ │
│                  Fallback Chain: server → cache → defaults   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Fallback Chain:**
1. **Server**: Fetch from `app_config` table via `app_launch_sync` RPC
2. **Cache**: Load from `config_cache.json` if server unreachable
3. **Defaults**: Use `AppConfig.defaults()` if no cache available

#### 9.12.2 Database Schema

```sql
-- Single-row table with all config as JSONB
CREATE TABLE app_config (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1 CHECK (id = 1),  -- Single-row constraint
  config_version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  config_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Returned via app_launch_sync RPC
-- { user, buff_multiplier, hexes_in_viewport, app_config: { version, data } }
```

#### 9.12.3 AppConfig Model Structure

```dart
class AppConfig {
  final int configVersion;
  final SeasonConfig seasonConfig;
  final GpsConfig gpsConfig;
  final ScoringConfig scoringConfig;
  final HexConfig hexConfig;
  final TimingConfig timingConfig;
  final BuffConfig buffConfig;
  
  factory AppConfig.defaults() => AppConfig(...);  // All hardcoded defaults
  factory AppConfig.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => ...;
}
```

#### 9.12.4 Configurable Constants by Category

| Category | Constants | Example Values |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Season** | `durationDays`, `serverTimezoneOffsetHours` | 40, 2 |
| **GPS** | `maxSpeedMps`, `minSpeedMps`, `maxAccuracyMeters`, `maxAltitudeChangeMps`, `maxJumpDistanceMeters`, `movingAvgWindowSeconds`, `maxCapturePaceMinPerKm`, `pollingRateHz`, `minTimeBetweenPointsMs` | 6.94, 0.3, 50.0, 5.0, 100, 20, 8.0, 0.5, 1500 |
| **Hex** | `baseResolution`, `zoneResolution`, `districtResolution`, `provinceResolution`, `captureCheckDistanceMeters`, `maxCacheSize` | 9, 8, 6, 4, 20.0, 4000 |
| **Timing** | `accelerometerSamplingPeriodMs`, `refreshThrottleSeconds` | 200, 30 |
| **Buff** | `elitePercentile`, `participationRateHigh`, `participationRateMid` | 20, 60, 30 |

#### 9.12.5 Run Consistency (Freeze/Unfreeze)

During an active run, config is frozen to prevent mid-run changes:

```dart
// In RunTracker.startNewRun()
RemoteConfigService().freezeForRun();

// In RunTracker.stopRun()
RemoteConfigService().unfreezeAfterRun();
```

**Usage Pattern in Services:**

```dart
// For run-critical values (frozen during runs)
static double get maxSpeedMps => 
    RemoteConfigService().configSnapshot.gpsConfig.maxSpeedMps;

// For non-critical values (can change anytime)
static int get maxCacheSize => 
    RemoteConfigService().config.hexConfig.maxCacheSize;
```

#### 9.12.6 Initialization

```dart
// In main.dart (after SupabaseService, before HexService)
await RemoteConfigService().initialize();
```

**Initialization Flow:**
1. Try fetch from server via `app_launch_sync` RPC
2. If success: Cache to `config_cache.json`, use server config
3. If fail: Try load from cache
4. If no cache: Use `AppConfig.defaults()`

#### 9.12.7 Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `supabase/migrations/20260128_create_app_config.sql` | Database table with JSONB schema |
| `supabase/migrations/20260128_update_app_launch_sync.sql` | RPC returns config |
| `lib/data/models/app_config.dart` | Typed model with nested classes |
| `lib/core/services/config_cache_service.dart` | Local JSON caching |
| `lib/core/services/remote_config_service.dart` | Singleton service |
| `test/services/remote_config_service_test.dart` | Unit tests (7 tests) |

#### 9.12.8 Services Using RemoteConfigService

| Service | Config Used |
|---------|-------------|
| `SeasonService` | `seasonConfig.durationDays`, `serverTimezoneOffsetHours` |
| `GpsValidator` | All 8 GPS validation constants |
| `LocationService` | `gpsConfig.pollingRateHz` |

### 2026-01-27 (Session 7)

**Fixed: Hex Map Flashing on Filter Change**

| # | Change | Type | Description |
|---|--------|------|-------------|
| 1 | GeoJsonSource + FillLayer pattern | **버그수정/UX** | Migrated from PolygonAnnotationManager to GeoJsonSource for atomic hex updates |
| 2 | Data-driven styling via setStyleLayerProperty | **기술/Mapbox** | Bypasses FillLayer constructor's strict typing limitation for expression support |

| 2 | Hex timestamp for conflict resolution | **필수/공정성** | Added `last_flipped_at` to hexes table; later run_endTime wins (prevents offline abusing) |
| 3 | OnResume data refresh | **필수/UX** | App refreshes map data when returning to foreground |
| 4 | Moving Average Pace (10 sec) | **권장/로직** | Changed from instantaneous pace to 10-second moving average (GPS noise smoothing) |

**Schema Changes:**
- Added `last_flipped_at TIMESTAMPTZ` to hexes table

### 2026-01-26 (Session 4)

**REMOVED: Daily Flip Limit**
- Deleted `daily_flips` table and `has_flipped_today()` function
- Removed `DailyHexFlipRecord` client model
- Same hex can now be flipped multiple times per day
- Simplifies logic and reduces database complexity

**Added: Table Separation (`runs` vs `run_history`)**
- `runs` table: Heavy data with `hex_path` → **DELETED on season reset**
- `run_history` table: Lightweight stats (date, distance, time, flips, points) → **PRESERVED across seasons**
- Personal run history now survives D-Day reset

**Updated: §4.2 Database Schema**
- Replaced `daily_flips` with `run_history` table
- Updated `finalize_run()` RPC to insert into `run_history`
- Updated partition management (run_history = permanent)

**Updated: §4.3 Partition Strategy**
- `runs`: Monthly partitions, seasonal (deleted on reset)
- `run_history`: Monthly partitions, permanent (never deleted)
- Removed `daily_flips` from partition table

**Updated: §4.4 Hot/Cold Data Strategy**
- New tier: "Seasonal" for `runs` (deleted on reset)
- New tier: "Permanent" for `run_history` and `daily_stats`

**Updated: §2.8 D-Day Reset Protocol**
- `runs` partitions dropped (heavy data)
- `run_history` preserved (lightweight stats)
- Updated SQL reset script

**Updated: Development Roadmap**
- Replaced "Daily hex flip dedup" with "Run history tracking"
- Updated pg_partman setup notes

### 2026-01-26 (Session 3)

**Updated: §2.5.3 Conflict Resolution ("Run-Level endTime")**
- Clarified that ALL hexagons in a run are assigned the run's `endTime`
- Example: User B (ends 11:00) beats User A (ends 10:00) for ALL their hexes, regardless of actual passage time
- Flip points calculated locally and uploaded as-is

**Updated: §2.6.1 Home Hex System (Asymmetric Definition)**
- Current user's home = FIRST hex (start point) — privacy protection
- Other users' home = LAST hex (end point) — standard behavior
- Privacy rationale: Don't reveal where you ended (potentially your actual home)

**Updated: §3.2.4 Running Screen**
- Replaced "Active Crew Runners" with "Yesterday's Crew Runners (어제 뛴 크루원)"

**Updated: §3.2.6 Run History Screen**
- Added timezone selector feature for displaying run history
